            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IF ever the practice of Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as any diſcourſe thereon, were ſeaſonable; it may be ſuppoſed now, when for ought we know, the laſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> may depend immediately upon this rare and deſirable temper, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of all moſt excellent.</p>
            <p>Yet it is a moſt unaccountable myſtery of our preſent condition, that notwithſtanding the late ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing diſcoveries have had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more notorious, than that the chief deſign of the Jeſuit Faction, among the Romaniſts, hath been the utter ſubverſion of the preſent eſtabliſhed <hi>Church of England:</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, they who call themſelves
<pb facs="tcp:96474:9"/>
our Proteſtant Diſſenters, cannot be induced to come into entire uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with our excellent reformed Church; but rather chuſe to unite with thoſe Romaniſts in many of their unreaſonable Cavils.</p>
            <p>One of the methods which they who are Principals or Acceſſories in our Diviſions, for our extirpation have uſed, hath been to engage the outcry in popular appeals concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Perſecution,</hi> or <hi>Moderation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This word and thing it ſelf hath indeed much in it which is very Divine; and therefore the more likely to be made uſe of with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, by thoſe who have uſed the moſt holy things to the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed purpoſes.</p>
            <p>But I ſuppoſe the Experience which the late Age hath taught us, will not ſo preſently be out of print in our minds, as to make us remit all our caution againſt the rigours of
<pb facs="tcp:96474:9"/>
both extremes; however they bear the ſame goodly pretences, and unite in the ſame reproach of our Church.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in ſincere deſire to aſſiſt the truth and equity of our Churches cauſe, as well as to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (if I may be ſo happy) ſome into a more intimate ſenſe of our common real intereſt: I thought it an act of Juſtice, as well as duty, to enter ſome kind of Proteſtation, and proof alſo of the <hi>Moderation of our Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That if our Diſſenting Brethren will but pleaſe to come near, and view ſuch fair and open teſtimonies as I have enumerated; ſome ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with ſo juſt a temper, may help to cool ſome of thoſe Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to aſſwage and allay ſome of thoſe unreaſonable diſorders, which have diſcompoſed the minds of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at preſent adverſe to our Peace.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:96474:10"/>
That while ſo remarkable a part of our Churches beauty appears from ſuch a lifting up of her Veil, ſo gentle and chearful an aſpect may we hope win over ſome of thoſe into better eſteem of our Communion, whom any Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try can affect, whom any Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration can overcome; if they are not already irreconcilable: that ſo the mildneſs and gentleneſs of our Church may no longer aggravate their ſeparation, with ſo much the more injuſtice, unthankfulneſs, and diſingenuity: even as the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Church and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment renders the attempts of ſuch Romaniſts as are concerned in them, not only more <hi>ſcandalous and pernicious,</hi> but moſt impious, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, and execrable.</p>
            <p>As for others among us, who ſometime have appeared weary of their conteſts; however unſetled,
<pb facs="tcp:96474:10"/>
hovering as it were in ſome moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Union, and frequently are toiling themſelves in tedious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of new Plots and Schemes of Government; framing to themſelves <hi>Idea</hi>'s, not very Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonical, for peace and ſettlement; I conceive a ſeaſonable conviction among ſuch of the real Moderation of our Church, might ſave ſome of them their grievous labours for the future: for how deficient they generally have been, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have ſhewed: and if our Church is very moderate already, I need not ſay they have been very ſuperfluous.</p>
            <p>There are indeed thoſe who are ſtill requiring that the Proteſtant Profeſſion among us be ſetled in a due Latitude; whereas we ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think the very thing deſired is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the true temperament of our Church: and ſuch alſo as in no
<pb facs="tcp:96474:11"/>
ſort encourageth any indifferency or neutrality in Religion, nor offers any ſuch Principles to her Sons, as allows them, <hi>Proteus,</hi> or <hi>Vertumnus</hi> like, to be ſuſceptible of divers ſhapes and forms in Religion; as our Adverſaries who do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand our Church, do ſuſpect: whereas the more any are fixed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the right Principles of our Church; the truer and firmer Proteſtants ſuch are, we ſhall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly prove: and the more any are ſuch, the more truly moderate they are, and their deſigns for peace muſt needs be the moſt diſcreet of any, and the more to purpoſe.</p>
            <p>So great a bleſſing I confeſs is leſs to be hoped for, ſo long as the Maſters of Factions have got ſuch a mighty Dominion over the minds of their followers, and have ſo far entangled them in their own paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and prejudices: neither is it
<pb facs="tcp:96474:11"/>
any wonder, that noiſe and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hardy confidence, iced over with ſome ſanctimonious pretences, can engage the affections of the vulgar, more than ingenuity and real Moderation: and when once this humour obtains of diſaffecting what is ſetled, with a luſt after No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties; if what ſome love to call the pattern in the Mount, ſhould ſlide down from Heaven in the midſt of them, it would not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue long in favour; and therefore no wonder if the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is antiquated among ſuch who are for new Modes in Eccleſiaſtical matters, to gratify their ſickly phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and moſt divided intereſts.</p>
            <p>While this affection is thus che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht, and thus kept up; the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief on't is, as when we preach ſuch Doctrines as the duty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church, and the like; they generally are moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb facs="tcp:96474:12"/>
whom the ſame concerns moſt; ſo all teſtimonies which are brought in the cauſe of Gods Church, are ſeldom taken notice of by ſuch, whom they are moſt proper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince: among the Romaniſts and the Separatiſts, the Keepers of the peoples underſtandings, not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to peruſe what may awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or enlighten them: and the more proper any thing is for that purpoſe, the more induſtrious are they ſlily to ſtifle the reputation of ſuch endeavours.</p>
            <p>However, I think it but juſt to vindicate unto publick authority the ſame fair interpretations, which all private perſons would gladly have for what they ſay or do: and where the Church hath given mild interpretations, on purpoſe for the general ſatisfaction of all, it is but reaſonable to make recognition of the ſame; and when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly
<pb facs="tcp:96474:12"/>
wreſted, fairly to ſet them forth: and certainly, it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to conſider publick appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which oblige us, with all reſpect to their true ends and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, equally repreſented<hi>:</hi> and it may be thought but a debt of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for us to acknowledge ſuch Liberties and Indulgences as we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; and to defend from malignant detractions the juſt wiſdom of the Church, in its excellent poiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween undue extremes.</p>
            <p>And ſo long as I have uprightly deſigned ſo juſt a duty, the eaſy foreſight of many ignorant or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious exceptions hath not daſht me out of countenance, but excited me; and the more, becauſe I hope I have not only endeavoured to ſet forth the Moderation of the Church, but to imitate the ſame: In ſo much, that where any thing is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to our Adverſaries (in our own
<pb facs="tcp:96474:13"/>
defence) I hope it hath not taken example from their own intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heats: and ſince the Son of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach</hi> hath bid us (Eccl. 37. 11.) <hi>Not conſult with a coward in matters of war, nor with an envious man of unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor with an unmerciful man touching kindneſs:</hi> we deſpair to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate advice of the Churches mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with thoſe who are of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful tempers themſelves: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more need we have all, as well as we can, to confirm one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the recognition of thoſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which juſtify the wiſdom of our Church, and afford our ſelves greater ſatisfaction in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity: although ſome are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually of ſuch diſturbed Spirits, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy to themſelves and moroſe, they can ſeldom allow any time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect chearfully and thankfully upon the bleſſings they enjoy; however they may give us leave to delight
<pb facs="tcp:96474:13"/>
our ſelves in the ſerious contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch proportions and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as in the frame of our Church are moſt obſervable.</p>
            <p>Which cannot but afford a rare and ſerious pleaſure as well as uſe; as it muſt be very delightful to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold any imitation of the Divine Wiſdom, which hath made all things in <hi>number, weight, and meaſure;</hi> which governs the World and all his Creatures, according to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable meaſures of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Equity, who diſpenſeth all things ſweetly and eaſily.</p>
            <p>The more any Civil or Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Governments partake of ſuch proportions, it cannot but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a fine and delicate reflection to find them out and admire them: Such is the lovely proſpect which we cannot but with delight take on the goodly frame and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <hi>beſt natured inſtitution in the World;</hi> which the Moderation of our Church doth properly cheriſh: and appears to be a moſt noble effect of the mild Oeconomy of the Goſpel: in the quiet and peace of whoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral reformation of the World, Bleſſed be God the particular refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb facs="tcp:96474:15"/>
of the Church among us, was very much alike: when a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſpirit of Moderation deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon our Church, like the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dew upon the Fleece of <hi>Gideon,</hi> or as the bountiful gifts came down from Heaven, accompanied with the ſenſible appearances of cloven tongues, in an innocent and lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent flame, on the heads of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and did them no harm: with ſuch harmleſs Peace and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration was the Reformation and Reſtauration of our Church brought about.</p>
            <p>But alas! ſince the very <hi>mildneſs</hi> and <hi>gentleneſs</hi> of our <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> by which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo affectionately entreats the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1.) too ineffectually prevails on the Chriſtian World: (Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no kind of temper hath ſuch proper charms for the very nature of mankind) no wonder if that

               <hi>Moderation</hi> which is the proper glory of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, either the <hi>Romaniſts or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts,</hi> to be ſenſible of that <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and law of kindneſs</hi> which attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers all the Commands and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of our Church: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I know no method which can more uſefully and compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly demonſtrate the true merit of our Churches praiſe, than by her <hi>Moderation,</hi> in which all vertues as it were, by one act of comprehenſion, are already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p>And if none hitherto have on ſet purpoſe undertaken to diſplay the ſame at large, the true reaſon might be, there are ſo many Vertues in our Churches Conſtitution, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if none have applied their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours unto every one of them in particular.</p>
            <p>It is this Moderation of our

Authority, ſo it was managed with due Moderation; the <hi>Idea</hi> of our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion having been impartial. §. 2. The whole manner of it (ſo far as concerned our Church) was with great temper. §. 3. She ſeparated from the Romiſh Errors, not from their Perſons any more than needs muſt. §. 4. Our Charity exceeds that of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which denies Salvation to all who are not of her Communion. §. 5.

it hath been the craft of the <hi>Roman</hi> Agents, to raiſe of it ſuch a ſuſpicion of Popery, as hath been artificially made a very unhappy Inſtrument of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which are from our Church. §. 2. How the great Labours of our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and our Clergy, remaining the moſt impregnable defence of the Reformation, hath ſtir'd up the more earneſt oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to our Church. §. 3. The vain and ungrateful jealouſies of our Separatiſts and Enthuſiaſts, are the more unjuſt, becauſe they have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared really acted by that Intereſt, (not in intention, but in event). §. 4.

               </p>
               <p>§. 1. WE have of late with both Ears, heard the loud de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands made for Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration among us: even ſince the Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Church, to its own admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and equal temper; even ſince the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Clemency of our moſt Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous King, and the extraordinary indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Laws, have really anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo much Moderation, as reaſonably might have dampt ſome of thoſe vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out-cries, which ſeem ſtill to offer violence to our ſenſes, as well as to the peace of the Kingdom, and the Church.</p>
               <p>But that the ſound might come more awful to religious Ears, on both ſides the cry hath been ſet up in the words of Holy Scripture: <hi>Let your Moderation be known unto all, the Lord is at hand.</hi> (Phil. 4. 5.)</p>
               <p>Moderation therefore being the word in faſhion, by which all divided parties among us uſe to ſanctify their appeals, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96474:28"/>
make their pretences ſeem virtuous; It is firſt to be wiſht that real Truth and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which are the genuine effects of true Moderation, were as common as the noiſe of either.</p>
               <p>§. 2. All agree that Moderation is an excellent vertue, as they ſaid of <hi>Hercules,</hi> Who ever diſpraiſed him? hence the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Factions make ſuch ſpecious pretences thereunto: The ſanctimonious Phariſees affected the appearance of mighty mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Men: they could in the very twinkling of an eye, caſt their countenances into a ſolemn mortify'd guize: and they were the firſt that inveighed againſt Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and cryed out<hi>: If we had been in the days of our forefathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the bloud of the Prophets:</hi> (S. Matt. 23. 30.) how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were in their principles prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to fill up the meaſure of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Wherefore our Bleſſed Lord called them <hi>Serpents</hi> (v. 33.) a ſubtle, nimble, inſinuating generation, full of folds and intrigues, humble and flexible in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Moderation, to wind and turn their pretences, but they were a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Vipers, immoderately cruel and dangerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96474:29"/>
In this (as in many other Inſtances) many of the Romaniſts and the Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts, exceedingly agree, as acted by the ſame ſpirit and practice of Phariſaiſm. The firſt compaſs ſome Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> take to make a Proſelyte, or a <hi>Novice</hi> (as our <hi>Homily</hi> calls him <note n="a" place="margin">Hom. of good Works.</note>) is with all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſemblance of Moderation: This they ſhew, this they promiſe, this they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge from others, as eſpecially their due: this upon ſundry occaſions they extol as peculiarly ſignal among themſelves.</p>
               <p>In the Recantation framed for <hi>Antonius de Dominis,</hi> he is made to extol <hi>the mild and fatherly care of the Holy Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

In thoſe Laws which reſpect Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Polity, and particularly the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the publick Aſſemblies, there is to be conſidered a Juſtice to God, as well as to one another; becauſe it is his worſhip and ſervice which is to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated.</p>

THE reaſon why this word Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration is ſo ſeldom apply'd in its moſt proper and uſeful ſenſe, by them that make moſt noiſe about it, is becauſe the licentious humour and wanton appetites of thoſe who affect novelty in Religion, are (through the liberty they have had) become more and more inſatiable; like the Horſeleech, they are ever crying, Give, Give; and the more Moderation is uſed, the more their cries are renewed; and to make their demands more plauſible, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration

The continual claim for Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being ſo often repeated in thoſe words of the Apoſtle: Since they are ſo exceedingly miſunderſtood by ſome, or obſtinately miſapply'd by others; it may be judged very fit to render the true ſenſe of the words as evident as may be, before we proceed. Thoſe who conſider the context may find the Bleſſed Apoſtle exhorting the <hi>Philippians,</hi> and in their name all that ſhould be perſecuted in the glorious cauſe of Chriſtianity; that they would endure their tryals at leaſt with all patience and equanimity; and if it might be, that they would rejoice in the midſt of their ſuffering condition: <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I ſay rejoice.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96474:40"/>
the Moderation of our Church, we will further inquire into their falſe notions of Moderation, who ſo vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently ſeem to require it in our Church: which requiries are made either to private perſons, or to thoſe in authority. 1. When private perſons are called upon to let their Moderation be known unto all men: They (as far as they know their own minds themſelves, and are not averſe to declare it in their writings and other expreſſions of their meaning undeniable) by Moderation would have</p>
               <p>1. Either an <hi>Indifferency,</hi> whether they do or do not what is required: or, 2. They mean an <hi>Omiſſion</hi> of what is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: or, 3. They underſtand by it the doing quite contrary.</p>
               <p>When appeal for Moderation is made to Governours: by Moderation they would underſtand, either</p>
               <p>1. A forbearance of the execution of Laws, (eſpecially which relate to matters Eccleſiaſtical:) or 2. An abolition of them: or 3. An utter alteration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So that all the burden for Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration relates to the remiſſion of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation and obſervance of the Laws (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially) of the Church: and their whole ſenſe of Moderation doth contain many
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96474:41"/>
odd ſuppoſitions: particularly, that the conditions of our Communion are very unlawful, very immoderate, and inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if in the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe we make it appear, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire conſtitution of our Church doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite as great Moderation, and as equal temper, as any Church in the Chriſtian World doth or ever did ſince the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Times; we ſhall juſtify our Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions from thoſe exceptions mentioned, and a thouſand times as many more as they can raiſe.</p>
               <p>For ſuppoſing at preſent, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I ſhall plainly demonſtrate, that the conditions of our Communion are not unlawful, and that the appointments of the Church as they are, and what relates thereunto, are very moderate: then it will plainly and neceſſarily follow,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That an indifference in doing or not doing what is required: or an omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what is matter of duty: or doing quite contrary, muſt needs be ſo far from Moderation, that it will appear to be a great affront to the authority of a well-ſetled Kingdom and Church: and the more moderate this is, the higher will be the aggravation of their crime.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:96474:41"/>
2. As to the forbearance of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch Laws, I ſhall only ſay thus much: That if for political conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Superiours ſhould give way at any time to ſuch a forbearance, it may not be unſeaſonable to conſider, as among the Jews there were ſome things permitted or tolerated; not for their own goodneſs, but becauſe of the hardneſs of the hearts of the people:</p>
               <p>So when Conſtitutions equal in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are remitted in conſideration only of the weakneſs of the people, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ought to be inſtructed of the reaſon they have to be humbled for their own imperfection, that they may not glory in their ſhame, leſt they go on to take heart againſt the Laws, and accuſtom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to frowardneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to change, or abolition of Laws, I only here touch upon what hereafter will be more amply ſhew'd.</p>
               <p>That the Moderation of our Church is ſuch, that ſhe always hath publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, That the Rites of the Church, and particular forms of worſhip, are in their own nature indifferent and mutable: And it is notorious matter of fact among us, that the Church hath often made thoſe alterations which occaſion hath required,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96474:42"/>
and for the ſame reaſons can do the like again.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As to an utter alteration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which ſome there are would look at as a prime point of Moderation: I ſhould be very injurious to truth if I ſhould not obſerve, That ſome who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with but deſires of Moderation, never leave till they end in the utter ſubverſion and extirpation of what they declare themſelves averſe from<hi>:</hi> which renders this undertaking more neceſſary. Thus King <hi>Charles</hi> I. <note n="m" place="margin">

In anſwer hereunto, let ſuch take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that the people among us, do bear as great a part as they ought, in what is conſtituted in our Church; whether they will own it or no: For where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people is not actually required, it is either included in the Laws of the Land (by which they are governed) or in the will of the King; to whom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his own power over the Church in his own Kingdoms, which is very great; in many Caſes they have made over their right <note n="e" place="margin">

The firſt of which may be the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and acknowledgments of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries on both ſides: Yea, if the ſcattered <hi>Conceſſions</hi> which have been made by our Adverſaries at ſundry times and upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers occaſions, ſhould be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a bundle; there is ſcarce any judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or practice, or conſtitution of our Church, but hath been acknowledged ſometime by ſome or others of them, as reaſonable and moderate.</p>
               <p>Yea, there is ſcarce any extravagance among themſelves, but hath been alſo confeſt and decryed by ſeveral of their own Communion: ſo great is the force of truth upon the minds of men at ſome times; when they are in a free humour to diſcloſe themſelves; and it might make a very pleaſant and uſeful Collection, to have theſe well gathered and ſet together: particularly, they have in their lucid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96474:47"/>
acknowledged the Moderation of our Church, ſometime as really convinced thereof: <hi>Notwithſtanding</hi> (ſaith one who left our Communion <note place="margin">

We obſerve that ſhe, and peradventure ſhe alone, has preſerved the face of a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued miſſion, and uninterrupted Ordination: Then in Doctrines, her Moderation is great. In thoſe of greateſt concern hath expreſt her ſelf very warily. In Diſcipline ſhe preſerves the Government by Biſhops, but above all we prize her averſion from Fanaticiſm, and that wild error of the private ſpirit, with which it is impoſſible to deal: from this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity the Church of</hi> England <hi>deſires to keep her ſelf free: She holds indeed, that Scripture is the Rule of controverſy; but ſhe holds withal, That it is not of private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation: for ſhe is for</hi> Vincentius <hi>his method. But I ſee that moderate counſels have been diſcountenanced on both ſides.</hi>

Others of the ſame denomination have appeared to acknowledge the Moderation of our Church, but it is manifeſt they have done it upon deſign; uſing that acknowledgment only as an Art, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Proſelyte ſome uncertain ones of our Communion, or elſe to divide us: thinking by their publick owning our Moderation, thereby to render us more odious to thoſe of another immoderate extreme. Yet the generality of both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme adverſaries join together in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching us for this Moderation; and by their immoderateneſs in ſo doing, do alſo juſtify the Moderation of our Church.</p>

                  <hi>her for Anti-Chriſtianiſm in her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline: The plain truth is, ſhe is betwixt theſe two Factions as between two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones: And it is very remarkable, that while both theſe preſs hard upon the Church of</hi> England; <hi>both of them cry out upon Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution</hi>

into Popery, and other Sects amongſt us (for what is beſt in it ſelf, is worſt when corrupted:) and as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is the perfection of other Philoſophies; ſo theſe corruptions of Chriſtianity have in them much of the very dregs of Judaiſm, and the worſt imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Gentiliſm.

pretences of <hi>infallibility</hi> on one hand, and <hi>enthuſiaſm</hi> on the other: between that Rock and this Gulf; the Moderation of our Church doth ſafely conduct its own judgment and practice, and all that follow her. In the <hi>Sixth Article of Religion,</hi> ſee how our Church doth own the perfection of Holy Scripture as a Rule. <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture containeth all things neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that whatſoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not required of any man that it ſhould be believed as an Article of Faith, or be thought requiſite or neceſſary to ſalvation:</hi> and the reaſon why the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth require her ſelf to be acknowledged of her own <note n="a" place="margin">Canon 3. 1603.</note> 
                  <hi>as a true and Apoſtolical Church, is becauſe ſhe teacheth and maintains the Doctrine of the Apoſtles;</hi> and in the fourth Canon, the Church cenſures <hi>all Impugners of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and whoſoever ſhall affirm her Form containeth any thing in it repugnant to the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the 36. <hi>Canon, Article</hi> 2. All who are to <hi>ſubſcribe,</hi> are willingly (and <hi>ex ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo)</hi> to affirm, <hi>That the Book of Common-Prayer, and of ordering Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, containeth in it nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the word of God:</hi> and <hi>Article</hi> 3. <hi>That he acknowledgeth all and every of the</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:96474:52"/>
39. <hi>Articles to be agreeable to the word of God.</hi> In the <hi>19th Article of Religion, The viſible Church of Chriſt</hi> is defined; <hi>a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of faithful men, in the which the</hi> pure word of God <hi>is Preached, and the Sacraments be duly adminiſtred according to</hi> Chriſts Ordinance.</p>
               <p>And in the <hi>ordering of Biſhops and Prieſts,</hi> it is asked: <hi>Be you perſwaded that the Holy Scriptures contain ſufficiently all Doctrine required of neceſſity for eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through Faith in Jeſu Chriſt? And are you determined with the ſaid Scriptures to inſtruct the people committed to your Charge; and to teach nothing (as required of neceſſity to eternal Salvation) but that you ſhall be perſwaded may be concluded and proved by the Scriptures?</hi> The Anſwer is, <hi>I am ſo perſwaded, and have ſo determined by Gods grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>20th Article of Religion,</hi> it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>It is not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing contrary to Gods word written; neither to expound one place that it be repugnant to another.</hi> From all which paſſages (and many more which might be repeated out of the Monuments of our Church) it is evident, that as our Church is formed in her whole Conſtitution, with an uniform reſpect to this Rule; and hath
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96474:53"/>
framed her Articles, Liturgy, Homilies, and Orders thereby; ſo it doth require her ſelf to be acknowledged in thoſe, but in ſubordination to this Rule and meaſure as before, and ſuperiour to it ſelf: which doth manifeſt the exceptions of many of the Separation to be very unreaſonable, who ſeem to give ſuch deference to the Holy Scriptures, and at the ſame time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Communion with the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which doth ſo religiouſly hold to the Sacred Scriptures; of which our Church in union with the whole Church of God, is a ſure <hi>Keeper,</hi> a faithful <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> a zealous <hi>Defender,</hi> and a moſt ſober <hi>Interpreter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 2. The Moderation of the Church of <hi>England</hi> further appears, in avoiding the extremes of thoſe who <hi>take away</hi> from the true <hi>perfection of Scripture;</hi> and of others, who ſeem officiouſly to <hi>add</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Of the firſt ſort of thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the true perfection of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are they who frame an additional Canon of their own, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth; who declares, that the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal</hi> Writings and <hi>Traditions</hi> of men, are nothing inferiour nor leſs Canonical, than the Sovereign dictates of God; as
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96474:53"/>
well for the Confirmation of doctrinal points pertaining to Faith, as for order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Life and Manners; and that both the one and the other ought to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced with the <hi>ſame affection of Piety,</hi> and received <hi>with the like religious Reverence</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Concil. Trid. Seſſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Decr.</hi> 1.</note>, not making any difference between them: Thus (as it is in the ſecond part of the Homily of good works) <hi>Chriſt reproved the Laws and Traditions of the Scribes and Phariſees, becauſe they were ſet up ſo high, as though they had been</hi> equal <hi>with Gods Laws and above them: They worſhip Me in vain, that teach for Doctrines the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of men: For you leave the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God to keep your own Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: Yet He meant not thereby to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Mens Commandments; for He Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was obedient to the Princes and their Laws made for good order.</hi> On the other extreme, They of the Separation among us, are buſy to attribute to the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſuch a perfection as God never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them; namely, particularly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of all actions of Mankind, and every matter of order and decency in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Between theſe two, ſee by how even a thred our Church divides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy: firſt aſſerting the real perfection of Scriptures as a Rule to be as much as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96474:54"/>
need to be, to be as great a perfection as God hath given it, in order to its end, namely to guide our belief and practice in things needful to Salvation: <hi>Article</hi> 20. <hi>Beſides the ſame (namely Gods word writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) ought not the Church to enforce any thing to be believed for neceſſity of ſalvation:</hi> and in the ſame Article<hi>: It is not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing contrary to Gods word written:</hi> Yet the Article be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins thus<hi>: The Church hath power to Decree Rites and Ceremonies, and hath Authority in controverſies of Faith:</hi> Wherein, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to an accurate Moderation the Church doth behave itſelf, in attributing to the Holy Scriptures their juſt and full perfection.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, our Church doth thankfully accept of that Chriſtian Liberty which God hath left her, and indeed which he hath given all particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians according to their meaſures; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leave to determine their particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according to the general Rule of Holy Scriptures, and ſometimes of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, where other Laws are not given to determine their Liberty.</p>
               <p>And indeed this Article of the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Scriptures, and the uſe of them as a Rule, is the very dividing
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96474:54"/>
point, at which thoſe of the Separation on either hand leave our Church and her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration at once: For thoſe who are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on one hand to receive all Traditions which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can offer, with affection and reverence equal to the written word of God; <hi>ſo that</hi> (as it is in our Homily <note n="c" place="margin">Homily of good works, 3<hi>

                  </note>) <hi>The Laws of</hi> Rome <hi>(as they ſaid) were to be received of all men as the four Evangeliſts,</hi> No Moderation can contain the extravagancies ſuch belief leads them to. On the other hand, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of no appointment for outward order and government in the Church or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but what is ſet out in the expreſs word of God for the direction of every particular action, under pretence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Chriſtian Liberty, is verily ſo groſs and unreaſonable a Phariſaical confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, that this principle is the firſt San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary of ignorance, and diſobedience in moſt of our Separatiſts; who under an immoderate pretence to Religion, and the honour of Scriptures, really offer great abuſe and diſſervice to both: as it is a real abuſe to a perſon, though of honour, to give him Titles which do not belong to him; ſo it is an occaſion to Atheiſts and prophane perſons, captiouſly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the true perfection of Holy
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96474:55"/>
Writings, when they find attributed to them ſuch Titles as are falſe and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: <hi>We muſt take heed</hi> (ſaith the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Hooker</hi>

               <p>On this foundation of our Churches Moderation in what ſhe judgeth concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perfection of Holy Scripture; both the Proteſtant and the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is eſtabliſhed: For as Biſhop <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon</hi> ſaith <note n="e" place="margin">Pref. to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note>, <hi>The main Article of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion is, The Holy Scriptures are a perfect Rule of Faith and manners: ſo the very myſtery of Puritaniſm is, That no man may with a ſafe Conſcience do any thing for which there may not be produced either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or example in Scripture.</hi>

               <p>In theſe (as in many other inſtances) our Sectaries generally agree with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts: 1.

               <p>Between theſe two oppoſers of Holy Scripture, at preſent there appears this difference: inſtead of an external infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Interpreter on one ſide, the other ſets up the witneſs of their own private ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit for an infallible interpreter alſo.</p>

               <p>Other ancient Verſions and Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which have been of Holy Scripture, our Church is ſo far from rejecting or undervaluing, that it hath made great uſe of them, and doth conſtantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their uſefulneſs: and doth eſteem them according to their antiquity and the approbation they have had in the Church of God.

               <p>§. 8. The Divine Authority of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, our Church according to great wiſdom doth rather take for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than labour much to prove ſuch an undoubted principle of Religion; juſtly ſuppoſing there is no reaſon either to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that the Church hath ſurely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thoſe Divine Oracles, or ſurely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them: and therefore our ſixth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle ſpeaks of them as of whoſe authority there was never any doubt in the Church: Our Church (juſtly thus ſuppoſing) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96474:62"/>
therefore applies her ſelf in an Exhortation to a diligent reading the Holy Scriptures <hi>(Homily</hi> 1.) and ſo long as thoſe of her Communion are by any juſt means convinced of their authority, our Church according to a great Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion leaves it to the Providence of God by what particular arguments (of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which lie before us) we may come to this ſatisfaction: Not cauſing the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of any to depend upon one ſort of means to the neglect of another: Becauſe there are ſo many Arguments which may ſufficiently ſatisfy any of their Authority; becauſe ſome are convinced by ſome, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by others. We are encouraged in our Church to receive the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as the word of God, both from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward motives; both of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and moral conſideration: But for our greater certainty and ſafety in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo great concern; our Church doth not lay the weight of ſo great a cauſe, on ſlight or uncertain Foundations; as the infallibility of the Church (much leſs demonſtration from the evidence of oral tradition) or the teſtimony only of the Divine Spirit, held by ſome ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to convince every one of the Divine Authority of Scriptures,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96474:62"/>
that without ſuch an inward teſtimony there can be no kind of certainty what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. The Moderation of our Church excellently governs her judgment herein; neither refuſing the juſt Authority of Gods true Church, nor denying any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary influence of the Holy Spirit of God: according to which Moderation, guiding our ſelves, we ſhall have occaſion elſewhere to juſtify the real certainty of our Faith, <hi>ch.</hi> 6. §. 8.</p>
               <p>In convincing alſo thoſe of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Holy Scripture, who do deny the ſame; the wiſdom and temper of our Church prudently hath omitted a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>medium,</hi> as improper to confute ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Adverſaries: The one is, of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Divine Authority of the Scriptures by Scriptures themſelves;</hi> which though it be a ſufficient proof among them who have received them as divine, yet to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it can never ſtop the objection from returning infinitely, if the objector pleaſe to be diſſatisfied: The other method is, <hi>alledging the Teſtimony of the Spirit;</hi> for though the Church of God hath the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, yet thoſe that diſpute this point may not have the Spirit; neither can any ones ſaying ſo, be a proper Argument to convince another: Thirdly, Our Church
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96474:63"/>
avoids the Circle of proving the Scripture by the Church, and the Church by the Scriptures again, becauſe our Church doth firſt acknowledge the Holy Scriptures as ſuperiour to it ſelf <note n="o" place="margin">Article 6. &amp; 20.</note>, as one of the firſt principles of its Doctrine, and againſt thoſe who deny that principle of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures veracity, it doth diſpute no otherwiſe than by reaſons convincing the certainty of Tradition.

3. Our Church doth not attribute more or leſs <hi>authority</hi> to the means of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting Scripture, or any part thereof, than God hath given it for that purpoſe: and here the Moderation of the Church might be illuſtrated from the manifold extravagancies others have run into, in this matter, on all ſides.</p>
               <p>1. Some make the Holy Spirit of God the only immediate interpreter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (unto all perſons whatſoever, that at any time underſtand any thing thereof.) Others run into another extreme of ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the illumination and aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit. 2. Some aſſert the Church (of <hi>Rome</hi> only) to have an infallible and abſolute Authority herein: others deny both the Church Univerſal, and all parts thereof, all authority to teach thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Diſcipline, or interpret any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to them. 3. Some have maintained, that the publick Magiſtrate is the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of Scripture: others deny him any kind of authority over or about the Church. 4. There are thoſe who make humane reaſon the only interpreter of Scripture: Others reject all uſe of reaſon in divine matters. Among theſe and many more extravagancies of men, The Moderation of our Church keeps

               <p>§. 1. THE Moderation of the Church of <hi>England</hi> appears very great in her due applying this Rule of Faith to her ſelf: wiſely and fitly making uſe of all thoſe Inſtruments which are moſt proper and uſeful in conveying to us that Rule, or which are moſt ſubſervient to the right underſtanding our Rule, avoiding either extreme of thoſe who attribute too much or too little to thoſe inſtruments of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance and interpretation: Such as the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96474:66"/>
Authority of the Univerſal Church: The Decrees of Councils: The Teſtimony of the Fathers: Other Traditions: The Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our own particular Church: Right Reaſon alone: The Teſtimony of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>To all and every of theſe enumerated inſtruments; either of certain convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or interpretation of Scripture; our Church gives their due place and eſteem, according to their influence and uſe, and no more: which muſt needs demonſtrate a great deal of Wiſdom and Moderation in the judgment of the Church.</p>
               <p>1. The Univerſal Church it ſelf is no where by the Church of <hi>England</hi> made the Rule of her Faith, but a <hi>Witneſs and Keeper of Holy Writ: Art.</hi> 20.

               <p>Yet becauſe of their Proximity to the Apoſtolick times, and the juſt authority in the Church, which for their Learning and Piety they have obtained, and all along hath been given them, Our Church in her Monuments, gives a great defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their judgment, teſtimony, and practice.</p>

                  <hi>Chryſoſtom) we may learn plentifully of the Scripture.</hi> And in the 19. Article of the Church: The Preaching of the pure word of God, and the Adminiſtration of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96474:85"/>
the Sacraments, are made indiſpenſable notes of the viſible Church: namely, in all things that <hi>of neceſſity are requiſite to the ſame:</hi> and the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article declares, <hi>The three Creeds ought throughly to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and received, for that they may be proved by moſt certain warrant of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> where our Church gives the reaſon of her Faith, and ſheweth her earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in contending for it: But the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Church contains her ſelf within the bounds of what is before made neceſſary. The principal and eſſential points of the Doctrine of Salvation (ſuch as are fit to make up the unity of the Faith, and conſtitute a Church) are no other among us, than what Chriſt and his Apoſtles at firſt made neceſſary, which alſo the ancient Church received as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unto Baptiſm, and for diſtinction of Hereſy: which fundamental Maxims of Chriſtian Science, are frequently and plainly repeated in Scripture, and by our Church were firſt of all inſiſted on at the reformation of our Church: as we ſee in the <hi>Inſtitution of a Chriſtian Man</hi> (1537.) in the firſt Injunctions of our Kings, and our Form of Catechiſm.

the abuſes and encroachments of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts in their contrary affirmatives: few, if we conſider, either the time, or the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their being framed; it being juſt about the meeting at <hi>Trent,</hi> made it neceſſary for our Church to declare her ſenſe of many Doctrines, for the better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and directions of her Sons, and to teſtify her equal conditions of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: Eſpecially alſo, if we conſider the cruel number of Articles, which either the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Divines, or the <hi>Trent</hi> Councellors have impoſed on their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>

                  <hi>King</hi> James (Jan. 18. 1616.) ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to the Univerſities; <hi>That young Students in Divinity ſhould be excited to ſtudy ſuch Books as were moſt agreeable to the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of</hi> England: <hi>and beſtow their time in the Fathers, and Councils, and Schoolmen, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories and Controverſies; and not to inſiſt too long on Compendiums and Abbreviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, making them the ground of their ſtudy.</hi> Auguſt 4. 1623. In his Letter to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop: <hi>Whereas divers young Students, by reading of late Writers and ungrounded Divines, do broach many times unprofitable, ſeditious and dangerous Doctrines, to the ſcandal of the Church:</hi> He injoin'd, <hi>That none under a Biſhop or Dean, do preſume to preach in any popular Auditory, the deep points of Predeſtination, Election, Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality, Reſiſtibility, or Irreſiſtibility of Gods Grace. But rather confine themſelves wholly to thoſe two Heads, of Faith and a good Life, which are all the ſubject of the ancient Sermons and Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies:</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:96474:92"/>
                  <hi>That no Preacher of any denomination whatſoever, ſhall preſume to fall into bitter invectives, and undecent railings, againſt the Perſons of either Papiſts or Puritans; but modeſtly and gravely, when they are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by their Text, free both the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>from the Aſperſions of the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> (of Bleſſed Memory) ſet forth with the Articles a Declaration 1630. wherein he required thus: <hi>In theſe curious and unhappy differences which have for ſo many hundred years in different times and places exerciſed the Church of Chriſt; We will that all further curious ſearch be laid aſide, and theſe diſputes ſhut up in Gods promiſes, as they be generally ſet forth to us in Holy Scriptures, and the general meaning of the Articles of the Church of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>It is to be wiſht, that all the Directions concerning Preachers, in the ſeveral Kings Reigns, ſince the Reformation, were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on the minds of all the Clergy and others; eſpecially, <hi>His preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Directions, Dated</hi> October 14. 1662. <hi>Which among other great reaſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, were ſet forth becauſe of the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance of ſundry young Divines, who took upon them in their popular Sermons, to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:96474:93"/>
                  <hi>the deep points of Gods Eternal Counſels and Decrees, and other fruitleſs controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, ſerving rather to amuſe than profit the hearers; which is done for the moſt part, and with greateſt confidence by ſuch perſons as leaſt underſtand them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore they are admoniſht not to ſpend their time in the ſearch of ſuch abſtruſe and ſpeculative notions. However, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume not poſitively and doctrinally to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine anything concerning the ſame: And for the edifying the people in Faith and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, That they in their ordinary Sermons inſiſt chiefly on Catechetical Doctrines (wherein are contained all the neceſſary and undoubted verities of Religion) declaring withal, unto their Congregations, what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences ſuch Doctrines ought to have into their Lives and Converſations; and ſtirring them up effectually, as well by their Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as their Doctrines, to the practice of ſuch religious and moral duties as are the proper reſults of the ſaid Doctrines; as Self-denial, Contempt of the World, Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Patience, Meekneſs, Temperance, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Mercy, Obedience, and the like, and to a deteſtation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And becauſe theſe licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious times have corrupted Religion in the very roots and foundations, That where there is an Afternoons Exerciſe, it be eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>

               <p>The ſubſcription for Univerſity Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> keeps its Subſcribers within the ſame bounds; and by the way, I may note the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Excellent temper of our <hi>

               <p>In the Inſtructions of King <hi>James</hi> 1618. to the Divines He ſent over to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Dort,</hi> One was, <hi>That they ſhould adviſe the Miniſters of thoſe Churches, that they do not deliver in the Pulpit to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, thoſe things for ordinary Doctrines which are the higheſt points of Schools, and not fit for vulgar capacity, but are diſputable on both ſides; and that they carry themſelves with that advice, moderation and diſcretion, as became them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>After all theſe great Teſtimonies of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in our Church, it is proper to mention what we meet with in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hammonds</hi> Diſcourſe of Gods Grace and Decrees, §. 24. <hi>This I ſuppoſe the reaſon, both of our Churches Moderation in framing the Article of Predeſtination,</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:96474:94"/>
                  <hi>and of our late Kings Declaration in ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the debate of the Queſtion: For if by theſe methods the Church could but have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to have the Definitions of the ſeveral pretenders forgotten: All men contenting themſelves as our Article preſcribes, with the Promiſes of God as they are declared in Scripture; the turmoil, and heat, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence of diſputes, had been prevented, which now goes for engagement in Gods cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And bleſſed be God, the deſign of the Churches Moderation, and of our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King (the Churches Moderatour and Governour) hath thus far had excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent effect in the Church and our Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities; that for a long time there hath been a great ſilence from that noiſe and learned ſquabble, which ſometimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly diſturbed the Churches Peace: ſo that now we may be more at leiſure, without prejudice and paſſion, to review and admire the wiſe and excellent deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of our Church.</p>
               <p>§. 6. To ſhew how well the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of the late Age have been mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by our Church, might deſerve a juſt Treatiſe by it ſelf: But our Church ſeems to obſerve the ſame advice which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:96474:95"/>
King <hi>James</hi> gave to the Divines going over to <hi>Dort,</hi> 1618. <hi>In caſe of oppoſition between any over-much addicted to their own opinions, their endeavours ſhould be, that certain Poſitions be moderately laid down, which may tend to the mitigation of heat on both ſides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Church throughout hath done the ſame thing, as might be inſtanced at large in the Controverſies between us and the Romaniſts; and between others alſo: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Articles, and eſpecially the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, do copiouſly and fitly moderate in theſe diſputes, which not long ſince very much exerciſed Chriſtendome: as for inſtance, when the Homilies declare, <hi>Juſtification is not the office of man, but of God only, which we receive of him by his free mercy, and by the only merits of his moſt dearly beloved Son. Yet our Faith in Chriſt (as it were) ſaith unto us, It is not I that take away your ſins, but it is Chriſt only; nevertheleſs by Faith we embrace the promiſe of Gods mercy. Such a Faith, whereof doth follow a loving heart to obey his Commandments. Juſtification by Faith, only freely and without works, is ſpoken to take away clearly all merit of works, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to deſerve our juſtification at Gods hand, and thereby doth expreſs the weakneſs</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:96474:95"/>
                  <hi>of man, and the goodneſs of God:</hi> (Yet) <hi>the true, lively, and Chriſtian Faith, is no dead, vain, or unfruitful thing, but a thing of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vertue, and of wonderful operation, and working, and ſtrength; bringing forth all good motions and good works: therefore let us by ſuch vertues as ſpring out of Faith, ſhew our Election to be ſure and ſtable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſuch and many like paſſages, are known the excellent Wiſdom and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Church: particularly, as we have ſeen, attributing unto good works, no more nor no leſs, than what is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the grace of the Goſpel: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring moſt earneſtly againſt the Roman opinion of merit by them: and yet (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s, and Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Injunctions have it) doth recommend <hi>Charity and Hoſpitality as a true worſhipping of God.</hi> And albeit the Romaniſts have much vaunted in this particular, it hath not been doubted but the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſince the Reformation, hath as great Monuments of Charity as ever were before (under Papacy) in the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of time and place: ſo truly doth the publick Exhortation, to the Contribution of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi>'s building, conclude: <hi>Our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of</hi> Rome <hi>may be convinced, that our Piety is as generous and charitable as</hi>

                  <hi>theirs, but would not be ſo arrogant and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous; and whilſt we diſclaim the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, yet we moſt ſtedfaſtly believe the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and neceſſity of good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How far our Sectaries are deficient in this matter, it ſhall not be our buſineſs here to enquire, nor to repeat how ſlightly and reprochfully they have ſpoken againſt the truth in this matter.</p>
               <p>It may ſuffice to obſerve from what hath been ſaid, Nothing hath more vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the Doctrine of the Goſpel, the Grace of God, and merits of our Saviour, and eſtabliſhed the neceſſity of a good life, and prepared us for a comfortable death, than the doctrine of our Church rightly underſtood: wherein ſhe hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered her ſelf from all thoſe fond opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and other, have founded their peculiar Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which have diſquieted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded ſo many Chriſtians, and diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Church: Inſomuch that ſome who have been otherwiſe much addicted to their own ſuppoſitions, yet in many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of controverſy have readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Moderation of our Church.</p>

                  <hi>Very famous</hi> (ſaith D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Tully) through the whole World, is the moſt prudent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Church of</hi> England <hi>in her definitions of Faith, in which ſurely to all ſhe offers her ſelf in ſo equal a poiſe, that ſhe can afford no offence to ſober minds and lovers of truth; nor doth ſhe give any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of cavilling to ſlight and petulant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, of which in our Age, there is ſuch a ſwarm.</hi> And <hi>Sancta Clara</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Confeſſion goes on ſafely within this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, neither binding its followers to one ſide or other, but freely leaves theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (of Controverſy) to Scholaſtic diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 7. As of Doctrines, ſome are plain, others myſterious: and as our Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires conſent in nothing contrary to ſenſe and reaſon; ſo alſo ſhe hath always contained her ſelf from immoderate cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, even in treating of myſteries; uſing good caution, and yet not ſo much as to become ſceptical: making good ſearch for her own and others ſatisfaction, as is fit; and yet not too much, ſo as to run into extreme or nice curioſity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:96474:97"/>
Of ſuch myſteries as are revealed, our Church hath faithfully declared thoſe which God hath made requiſite for us to know (ſo far forth as is neceſſary) yet ſuch Moderation is uſed in the manner of declaring them, that ſhe hath prudently kept to the form of ſound words in holy Scripture, and the Declarations of the ancient Church: not diſclaiming the uſe of ſuch expreſſions which the authority of the firſt Councils, and the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the learned have received, while the words follow the thing it ſelf deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in Holy Scripture, though in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſyllables perhaps there not ſet down: which are not introduced into our Church to corrupt primitive ſimplicity, but to prevent the double meaning which others have invented for other Scripture expreſſions: and as our Church doth not intermeddle with what is above humane enquiry (<note n="n" place="margin">Firſt Part of the Sermon for Rogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Week.</note> 
                  <hi>It ſhall better ſuffice us in low humility, to reverence the Divine Majeſty which we cannot comprize, than by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much curious ſearching to be over-charged with the glory)</hi> ſo it doth not determine in thoſe things which are (as I may ſay) below its enquiry: namely, in things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to be known <note n="o" place="margin">

§. 8. In giving a reaſon of our hope, and in convincing our ſelves or others, of the truth of matters of Faith and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine; our Church doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon ſuch kind of certainties as others without reaſon do exact: The point of certainty is a nice ſtep which is taken in the firſt conſideration of Religion, and of great conſequence; wherefore we cannot but obſerve the great Moderation and care of our Church:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reſolving the firſt motive and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of believing, into the Teſtimony of God only, ſubmitting all rational enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries unto the Divine Teſtimony: when once there is aſſurance that the ſame te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony is Divine, our Church doth not make (nor ſuppoſe that there can be made by) any humane Judgment, a meaſure of what is incomprehenſible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Church doth accept and uſe ſuch rational evidences, as God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, as the means of being aſſured of the certainty that the Revelations which we receive as Divine, are ſuch: Becauſe the Divine Teſtimony is not immediate to us, nor neceſſary it ſhould be ſo, but is conveyed to the aſſent of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by ſome proper and juſt evidence.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96474:98"/>
The ordinary way of knowledge (allow'd us) is the conviction of our judgments and reaſons, concerning the truth of the Propoſition we aſſent to: which convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is made by ſuch proper arguments as may ſufficiently induce our belief: now, though there are innumerable arguments which convince us of the certainty of the Divine Teſtimony in the matters we have received; yet ſuch is the Moderation of our Church, ſhe doth not require every one in her Communion, neceſſarily to know and receive all the reaſons of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty which are and may be given; nor yet to rely on one to the neglect of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but leaves us to be ſatisfied accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the means and opportunities, which we have abundantly offered unto us: juſtly ſuppoſing there are ſo many reaſons perſwading the truth of what we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that ſome are convinced by ſome, others by others, as the Providence of God diſpoſeth things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Church no where makes infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible certainty of aſſent, a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Faith: it being ſufficient to make our Faith certain, if our Rule be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and that applyed with moral evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; that is, ſuch an evidence as we can have of things and actions paſt, as is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96474:98"/>
ſufficient to guide and govern our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and behaviour.</p>
               <p>Some of late have contended (with very ill ſucceſs) that an infallible certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of aſſent is neceſſarily wrought by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration (and what they love to call ſcientific Evidence) in every Believer: which doctrine of <hi>J. S.</hi> is condemned by his Adverſaries, even of <hi>Rome</hi> 
                  <note n="p" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>If deſtroying the firſt foundation of the Roman infallibility were all, we might diſpenſe with that inconvenience, as it renders their motives of credibility inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, which before the doctrine of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is received, uſed to be the only way they had to recommend the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to the approbation of Proſelytes: but to affirm, that all certainty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith is generally wrought by ſuch demonſtration; in caſe that doctrine proves falſe, the conſequence is, If Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith have no other certainty, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity it ſelf is left uncertain in its very foundations.</p>
               <p>Others there are who deliver, that an infallible certainty of aſſent wrought only
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96474:99"/>
by the immediate extraordinary operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit of God, is neceſſarily in every true Believer.</p>
               <p>Now, though our Church doth as much as any can do, own the neceſſity of Gods Grace and holy Spirit, to prevent, aſſiſt, and follow us; eſpecially in what concerns divine matters: yet our Church is not ſo bold with the Holy Spirit of God, to affirm, that ſuch an inward teſtimony of the Divine Spirit (working together in our Spirits an infallible aſſent) is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to aſſure us of the certainty of Faith, and of the authority of Holy Scriptures, and of the truth of other Doctrines in queſtion; as without which, we could have no ſuch belief as is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Salvation.</p>
               <p>Which precarious preſumption tends to render uſeleſs, all thoſe ſufficient eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces we have of Divine truth, by the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious means which God hath appointed ordinary in his Church: and whereas the aſſertors of this extraordinary ſpirit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all other means of real certainty as inſufficient; ſuch a Doctrine being falſe, muſt needs tend alſo to overthrow all Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>Such is the ſad conſequence of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines both of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>I. O.</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§. 10. So great being the Moderation of our Church; becauſe (never the leſs, as the temper of men generally now is among us, ſince theſe licentious times eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially have corrupted them) the moſt are very captious of what hath the fem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of priviledge (and ſuch alſo are moſt apt to neglect their duty) It is very great juſtice and equity, that all be convinced of the due ſubmiſſion we alſo owe to the <hi>Church,</hi> in reference to this matter: The ſum of which duty, I ſhall lay down in ſuch brief Propoſitions as are agreeable to an eaſy reaſon to infer from the comparing of relations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All good Chriſtians who love the Church of God, and its Peace, will for Truth and Conſcience ſake, hearken to the Church, and thoſe ſet over them, on purpoſe to guide and

               <p n="2">2. Such will well weigh the moments of reaſons which the Church offers, and be ready with all due regard to entertain what the Church reſolves: and readily alſo approve of thoſe reſolutions, unleſs it appear manifeſtly, that ſuch determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations contradict the word of God, and the ſenſe of the Univerſal Church; which no good man will unadviſedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, much leſs ſeek occaſions for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. If in any caſe it ſhould happen that ſuch ſhould differently opine or judge, however ſuch will afford a practical ſubmiſſion in many Caſes which they may and ought; the liberty of their

                  <hi>The Church hath been careful to put no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing into the Liturgy, but what is either evidently the word of God, or what hath been generally received in the Catholick Church; neither of which can be called pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinion: and if the contrary can be proved, we wiſh it out of the Liturgy.</hi> Yet, becauſe as (Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> ſaith) they could not Propheſie; they put in ſome things

Our Prayers are framed, both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a grave, modeſt, and ſerious manner; every one of them being mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſhort, and all together not immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately long; and ſo, more accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date to render Devotion more earneſt and intent: and properly intermitted by other parts of Divine Service, that by a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate variety, the Devotions of Chriſtians may be both entertained and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. And to ſtir up Devotion in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people, they bear in our Church a moderate part in the publick Prayers and Praiſes: for (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

               <p>§. 3. The Moderation of the Church is always to be admired, That in the heat of <hi>Reformation,</hi> when the Eſſays were firſt had for the refining our Liturgy from Romiſh corruption and innovation; our Church was not ſo tranſported with <hi>zeal,</hi> but that it retained what was pious and profitable among the Prayers in uſe: And whereas generally oppoſitions are moſt fierce at firſt, and in proceſs of time they become <hi>moderate;</hi> the excellent temper of our Church was ſuch, it was moſt <hi>moderate at firſt:</hi> which wiſdom and mercy of God, in tempering the Spirits of the firſt Reformers, can never be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough taken notice of: Wherefore the uſe of ſome Collects and paſſages in our Liturgy, which before were had in the Romiſh Communion; is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a real argument againſt our Church, that it is a proper proof of our Churches juſt <hi>Reformation,</hi> that it maintained its freedom from prejudice and paſſion, in the midſt of its zeal. If ſome parts of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96474:112"/>
the Prayers themſelves, and Liturgy, have been drawn into matter of debate; it is no more than what all words and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are liable to, when they meet with thoſe who are concern'd to be diſpleas'd: But the exceptions againſt them being ſuch, that (I ſpeak my Conſcience in what I know) the moſt probable means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile any to a juſt apprehenſion of our Liturgy, and to confirm them in the ſame, is well to conſider the feeble weakneſs of the exceptions which are uſed againſt it: Which King <hi>James</hi> noted long ſince; <hi>How mighty and vehement informations againſt the Common Prayer, were ſupported with weak and ſlender proofs! But</hi> (ſaith the <hi>King</hi>

               <p>So that all theſe things conſidered, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi>

                  <hi>Sacraments, and other Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; but alſo the Doctrine and Religion ſet out by King</hi> Edw. VI. <hi>to be more pure, and according to Gods word, than any other uſed in</hi> England <hi>theſe thouſand Years,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>§. 4. In all the Churches of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Cathedral and Parochial, the Church now hath moderately appointed the <hi>ſame Rules</hi> and <hi>Cautions,</hi> and the <hi>ſame uſe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us every where, and thoſe <hi>few</hi> in number, <hi>plain</hi> and eaſy to be underſtood; <note n="f" place="margin">The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Common-Prayer Book.</note> Whereas the Rubricks and Orders of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are ſo innumerable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, and various, that ſcarce an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiſhip may ſuffice to learn the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of them; which, whether it ſuit with the ſimplicity of the Chriſtian Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, may without difficulty be judged. Among us an eaſy <hi>Calendar</hi> is prefixt, with few Canons and Preſcriptions, and thoſe very intelligible: wherein according to an excellent Moderation the <hi>People</hi> have their parts for excitation ſake, and to unite their affections: (although no where in what is properly miniſterial.)</p>
               <p>§. 5. The Moderation of our Church is ſufficiently known to the whole World, in requiring our Common Prayers to be in the <hi>vulgar tongue,</hi> for the general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96474:113"/>
of all; According to our 24. Article. <hi>It is a thing plainly repugnant to the word of God, and the Cuſtom of the Primitive Church; to have publick Prayer in the Church, or to adminiſter the Sacraments in a tongue not underſtood of the people.</hi> Which Article is further confirmed and proved in the <hi>Homilies,</hi> eſpecially in that <hi>of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer and Sacraments:</hi> from the nature and end of Prayer: Reſolving al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: <hi>As for the time ſince Chriſt, till that uſurped power of</hi> Rome <hi>begun to ſpread it ſelf, and to enforce all the Nations of</hi> Europe <hi>to have the Romiſh Language in admiration, it appeareth by the conſent of the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and learned Writers, there was no ſtrange tongue uſed in the Congregation of Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet for the ſame reaſon that common people ſhould have their Prayers in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh among us; thoſe who have been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in ſufficient learning, are allowed to uſe them in another tongue: as in <hi>

Notwithſtanding, the Church hath provided moſt excellent Prayers, for the uſe of <hi>private devotion</hi> upon all general occaſions, and what is readily and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applicable to more occaſions parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: yet the Moderation of the Church hath not thought fit any where, to bind all who are of her Communion to the uſe of her Common Prayers in private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies or Cloſets.</p>
               <p>The Rubrick which enjoins, <hi>All Prieſts and Deacons, to ſay daily the Morning and Evening Prayer, either privately or openly,</hi> is ſet down with great Moderation.</p>

With theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I ſhall not contend, but only deliver my opinion freely about this matter: which is, that the reverence due to</hi> that Book, <hi>will be beſt preſerved, by employing it only in the</hi> publick Divine Service, <hi>or in the private, where there is a</hi> Prieſt <hi>to officiate: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the deſign of it is not to furniſh the people with Prayers for all thoſe particular occaſions, wherein devout Souls would make their requeſts known to God; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant opinions of pious Divines, in this and other Churches, we ſee by their Writings hath been, that other Books of Prayers are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the flock of Chriſt, beſide their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Liturgy.</hi> Though in the choice of ſuch Prayers as are ſo accommodate to the occaſions of humane Life, and ſuch Caſes as are incidental to the ſpiritual needs and circumſtances of Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, there hath been ſometimes wiſhed, ſome further advice and recommendation made common by Authority.</p>
               <p>The 55. Canon thus directs, <hi>That before all Sermons, Lectures, and Homilies, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Miniſters ſhall move the people to join with them</hi> in this Form, or to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: <hi>as briefly as conveniently they may</hi> [in

hunc aut ſimilem modum.] The Title in the Latine Canons is, <hi>Precationis formula à concionatoribus in Concionum ſuarum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſu</hi> imitanda: In the Engliſh Canons, the Title is, <hi>A Form of Prayer to</hi> be uſed <hi>by Preachers before their Sermon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all which I only note, That the Moderation of the Church is certain and undoubted: But the diſagreeing variety in practice conſequent thereon; whether it be ſo convenient, it remains for Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to judge.</p>
               <p>§. 7. Although ſome of the ancient Chriſtians uſed the diſtinction of <hi>Hours of Prayer,</hi> which at firſt was thought or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and uſeful, as a voluntary task; and determining of the Chriſtian Liberty of thoſe, who profeſs Gods Service is perfect freedom: Yet our Church conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the common employment of moſt, and the natural infirmities of all, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and required only a daily Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Morning and Evening Service (as of conſtant obſervance) not excluding, but inviting other voluntary oblations of a ſincere Devotion to God according to our leiſure and opportunity: But our Church doth no where countenance <hi>the novelties of thoſe that put any truſt in the</hi>

               <p>§. 8. Although according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, and in truth, the entire worſhip of God is complete in the Divine Service of the Church (even as among the Jews; Sacrifices, Prayers, and Thankſgivings, made up the entire noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Divine Worſhip; ſo under the Goſpel, the Sacrifices of Prayer and Thankſgiving, do abſolutely compleat the worſhip of God:) yet our Church judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth according to an excellent temper of the uſe and neceſſity of <hi>Sermons,</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging their great uſe as occaſion requires, to convince, reprove, to excite and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort Chriſtian people: Let Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> be heard for once by thoſe who have doubted his judgment in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note n="l" place="margin">Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> §. 16. <hi>Num.</hi> 31.</note>. <hi>I ever took Sermons and do ſtill, to be the moſt neceſſary Expoſitions and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Holy Scripture, and a great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means of Salvation:</hi> (To the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Hooker</hi>'s <hi>Eccleſ.

In all the Inſtructions and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Church, Her deſigns and intent appear very ſincere to promote the worſhip of God according to his Will<hi>:</hi> Wherefore our Church makes none elſe partakers of the Divine Worſhip; as neither Saints nor Angels, nor the Bleſſed Virgin.</p>
               <p>The Ceremonies (as will be further ſhewed) are not held by our Church as any part of the Divine Worſhip: but only outward ſigns and helps of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Our Church lays alſo greateſt ſtreſs upon the inward affection and intention of the mind, as the moſt neceſſary and principal part of the Divine Worſhip;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:96474:122"/>
as that which only can render all outward expreſſions of our Honour of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable: Becauſe in the affection of the Heart is the conſummation of all moral goodneſs <note n="t" place="margin">

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:96474:122"/>
our time and Eſtates to the honour of God, the humble ſervice of our bodies, reverend geſtures and behaviour, which are but proper and fit to encreaſe in our ſelves and others the inward honour of God alſo<hi>:</hi> In reſpect to both theſe parts of worſhip, thoſe who duly honour God, may be fitly denominated <hi>devout</hi> perſons. But the probable reaſon why many who call themſelves Saints, do diſdain the name of <hi>Devout,</hi> is, becauſe the Attribute of Devotion ſeems to intimate alſo the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> reverent behaviour of body, as the neceſſary Companion of the <hi>inward</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the mind; which outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence ſuch judge too meanly of.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, In our Church, the worſhip of God is ſuppoſed to proceed, not ſo much from a principle of fear and dread, as of love and thankfulneſs: Whereas ſome in a way to overthrow all Religion, have given out, That the fear of God is only the dread men have of ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, arbitrary, and uncontroulable power: Such a fear, they ſuppoſe the only motive to the worſhip of God; the only foundation and bond of Juſtice: An Experiment taken up to keep men obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to Laws.

matter, accounting the due fear of the Soveraignty and power of God, very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the good as well as the bad, to make all heedful and careful in their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Therefore in the Office of <hi>Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as in many other places alſo, the threats of God againſt impenitent Sinners, are by our Church denounced: Yet the firſt and the chief reaſon of our worſhip of God, is frequently owned (in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of our Church) and ſuppoſed to be a ſenſe of the Infinite Divine Excellencies, and his conſtant bounty and benefits, and gracious goodneſs to mankind, eſpecially in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: which of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are ſufficient motives to Religion: and make the ſame proceed from the moſt free, and moſt ſuitable, and noble principle that can be of affection and thankfulneſs to God.</p>
               <p>§. 13. Becauſe an <hi>Oath</hi> is an act of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, in which we ſolemnly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God as a witneſs to what we ſwear: It is but proper here to take notice of the Moderation of our Church in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to Oaths.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Church doth (in the 39. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Religion) excellently declare, and (in the Homily againſt perjury) at large
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:96474:123"/>
prove, The lawfulneſs and benefits of ſwearing for cauſes <hi>neceſſary and honeſt, and for the ending of controverſy,</hi> and ſets forth alſo the ſore danger of <hi>perjury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Church doth at large teſtify againſt cuſtomary and unneceſſary Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the mentioned Homily declares the danger and vanity thereof: Both theſe purpoſes of the Homily are briefly contained in the 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article: Thus: <hi>As we confeſs vain and raſh Swearing is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Chriſtian men by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and</hi> James <hi>his Apoſtle: So we judge, That Chriſtian Religion doth not prohibite, but that a man may ſwear when the Magiſtrate requireth, in a cauſe of Faith and Charity; ſo it be done according to the Prophets teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in</hi> Juſtice, Judgment, and Truth.</p>
               <p>In a few lines alſo of the Homily, our Church ſeems fully to determine the whole Controverſy, which our Sectaries have rais'd concerning Swearing: <hi>When Chriſt ſo earneſtly forbad Swearing, it may not be underſtood as though he did forbid all manner of Oaths; but he forbiddeth all vain Swearing and forſwearing, both by God and by his Creatures; as the common uſe of Swearing in buying and ſelling, and in daily Communication, to the intent every Chriſtian mans word, ſhould be as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:96474:124"/>
                  <hi>in ſuch matters, as if he confirm'd his Communication with an Oath: for the truth is</hi> (as <hi>Theophylact</hi> writeth) <hi>no man is leſs truſted than he that uſeth much to ſwear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſide the practice of the Gentiles, to ſwear by Creatures, the Jews had fallen into that Cuſtom, which gave our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>§. 1. AS in the foregoing Chapter I have not thought it neceſſary to ſtay the Reader by preſenting to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, the many proofs of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, antiquity, and advantages of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy in general; or by arguing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence and uſefulneſs of our publick Forms of Prayer in particular; becauſe any ſuch labour hath been ſufficiently ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, from the copious and unanſwerable performances of ſo many learned and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious men of our Communion, who have largely <hi>vindicated,</hi> and alſo have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the particular <hi>reaſons</hi> of our Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
               <p>So in this Chapter of the Ceremonies of our Church, which are only the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Inſtitutions for order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, I hold it (for the ſame reaſons
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:96474:128"/>
mentioned) unneceſſary, by many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to defend the lawful uſe or eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Eccleſiaſtical Rites, ſince the ſame have been abundantly proved: both from the liberty allowed to the <hi>Jewiſh Church;</hi> and alſo from what is warranted by the <hi>Apoſtolical Doctrine and practice;</hi> and is defended from the practice and judgment of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> and other <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches: and cannot (without very evil Conſequences, as are deſtructive to the intereſt of Religion) be denied any Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>All which, and much more, for the Vindication of our Church, hath been fully and judiciouſly evinced, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by my Excellent Friend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

The Ceremonies of our Church are but very few, and thoſe of great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, ſimplicity, decency and clear ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, hardly to be wreſted to the prejudice of inward piety: wherefore they are neither unprofitable, nor burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome (of which they are charged in the Preface to the Directory.)

So that in our Church, as our worſhip of God is ſuitable to ſolid and rational Devotion, ſo in the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Church (which refer to the Adminiſtration of the ſame) our Church appears neither to affect vain gaieties, nor outward ſplendor, nor ſuch luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant expreſſions, as are ſuited to feed the humours and boundleſs fancies of men: Retaining what is reverent and becoming, yet rejecting what is ſuperſtitious in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Conſecrations, Benedictions, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſms, which are in uſe in the Roman Church: which mild and wiſe Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Church, renders their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96474:136"/>
more unaccountably fooliſh and obſtinate, who are ſo peremptory in their Non-Conformity to the Orders of our Church: <hi>Since there is no Church in the World, which hath all its Offices and Sacraments ſo adminiſtred, conformably to the best Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, in words underſtood, without any mixture of dangerous or ſuperſtitious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments; and with that gravity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and ſolemnity, which befits the ſervice of God:</hi> as Dean <hi>Lingard</hi> (whom for love and honour to his memory, I name) in a Sermon of his before the King <note n="i" place="margin">

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:96474:140"/>
ſpecial Commiſſion given them to pray for Gods people and bleſs them: as the Prieſts under the Law had Commiſſion to bleſs the people in the name of God, <hi>Numbers</hi> 6. 22. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 8. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 13. Which practice had nothing Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial in it, and peculiar to the Law.

S. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 5. and without all contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the leſs is bleſſed of the greater, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 7. Wherefore for the dignity of the Epiſcopal Office, the Church doth eſpecially delegate that Power and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to her Biſhops for Confirmation, with impoſition of Hands, and in Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither do our Religious <hi>Kings</hi> in our Church, refuſe the Benedictions of the Churches Miniſters: either as Chriſtians, or as Kings at their <hi>Coronations:</hi> Yea our Church indeed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes more to Bleſſing and Prayer than the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth: for by Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Prayer, our Church holds the Bread and Wine in the Holy Euchariſt to be Conſecrated, which the Roman Prieſts do not, till thoſe words be pronounced. <hi>[Hoc eſt enim Corpus meum.]</hi>

               <p>The Moderation of our Church, in its judgment of the Lords Day, Biſhop <hi>Bramhall</hi> hath obſerved, from the Homily of the Church, as concurrent with his own judgment <note n="u" place="margin">Diſcourſe of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, or Lords Day, p. 932.</note>: 1. <hi>That the Homily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth not the Lords Day the name of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: That it finds no Law of the Sabbath,</hi> Gen. 23. <hi>That the Homily finds no ſeventh Day Sabbath before</hi> Moſes <hi>his time: The Homily gives no power to the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, as it was given to the Jews, to oblige Chriſtians, but only as it was, and ſo far as it was a Law of nature: The Homily makes the firſt day of the week to ſignify the Lords Day: The Homily makes the end of changing the Weekly Feſtival of the Church</hi>

Church, with the Apoſtle, doth chiefly endeavour to promote the grace and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the heart, which is moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to inſpire our praiſe: The ſincere ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Spirit, being the life of all our Pſalmody, even that half which makes the whole, without which the tongues of men and Angels (as without Charity) are like a ſounding braſs, or tinkling Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal. Where this grace of the heart is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the melody of the Voice, we may entertain our ſelves with that joy in God, which is the moſt refined ſort of delight we can enjoy: We join with the Church Militant on Earth, and the Church Triumphant in Heaven: We make the beſt uſe of that gift of Speech which we have given us to interpret our thoughts by articulate voice, and ſtir up our own and others affections to ſet forth the high praiſes of the moſt Excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God: whom it becomes us to ſerve not only with our nature, but our <hi>skill.</hi>

our Saviour (S. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 31.) <hi>Whereunto ſhall I liken the men of this Generation? They are like unto Children ſitting in the market place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For as when <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the infinite wiſdom of God ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it) appeared in all mortification and ſelf-denial, as was moſt fit to prepare the way of the Lord: humble in his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and behaviour, very abſtemious and ſparing in his diet and courſe of Life: that he might bring off the Jews from expecting a pompous Meſſias, which they, newly oppreſt by the Tyranny of the Roman power, were hugely inclined to promiſe themſelves: and after him our Bleſſed Lord came more ſociable and publick in his Converſation, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Doctrine and example more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiouſly unto all: Yet the men of that Generation, the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees on one hand, and the gentile Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers on the other, would neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves nor comply with either diſpenſation; refuſing to enter into the Temple, by the gate of the Bridegroom, or by the gate of the Mourners; and inſtead of Piping or Dancing with their Fellows, as each reaſon of the time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; they rather fill'd the Market

               <p>One while, if we obſerve the Rules of the Church, in our abſtinence and retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and imitate <hi>John</hi> Baptiſts ſeverity, thereby to prepare the way of the Lord: At other Seaſons, if we imitate our Bleſſed Saviour in his blameleſs liberty, (albeit with ſuch Moderation and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion as the Church requires): Yet both <hi>the Church</hi> for enjoining, and <hi>her Sons</hi> for obſerving thoſe Injunctions cannot eſcape the dint of their keeneſt <hi>cenſures.

Believers have not, authoritatively to declare this Abſolution and Remiſſion of Sin, for the benefit and conſolation of true Penitency, which if duly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, cannot but have a real effect from the very promiſe of Chriſt. (S. <hi>Jo.</hi> 20. 23.) <note place="margin">

all claim to ſuch Power and Authority: Tho the regulating and ordering that Power in ſundry Circumſtances concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the outward exerciſe thereof <hi>(in foro externo)</hi> the godly Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have thought to belong to them as in the right of their Crown, and have accordingly made Laws concerning the ſame, even as they have done alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning other Matters appertaining to the Religion and Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>§. 4. Which being well conſidered, we have great reaſon to obſerve and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol the excellent and pious Moderation of our <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who never challenged to themſelves the exerciſe of the pure Spiritual Power of the Church, but left it entirely to the Biſhops, as the lawful Succeſſors of the Apoſtles. Which more fully appears from the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the <hi>13th Year of King</hi> Charles <hi>the Firſt of bleſſed Memory,</hi> according to the Certificate of the Right Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Judges under their Hands, <hi>July</hi> 1. 1637.

And the behaviour of the Church to the King, ſheweth the ſame Exemplary Moderation: For the Eccleſiaſtical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are with all due ſubordination to the Supreme Power ſecular uſed: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all external juriſdiction coercive is by Law declared, and by the Clergy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be wholly and entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the King, as the ſole fountain of all Authority of external juriſdiction, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spiritual, or Temporal, within this Realm: In other Matters, tho the ſubſtance of the Power it ſelf be immediately from God, and not from the King, (as thoſe of Preaching, Ordaining, Abſolving,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>Yet are they ſo ſubject to be inhibited, limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or otherwiſe regulated in the outward exerciſes of that Power by the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Land, as that the whole execution thereof ſtill depends on the Regal Authority.</hi>

               <p>§. 5. Other Sects among us do ſome way or other deny the King's Supremacy in Matters Eccleſiaſtical: either claiming a power of Juriſdiction over him, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a privilege of Exemption from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him: The <hi>Papiſts</hi> do it both ways in their ſeveral Doctrines of the Pope's Supremacy, and of the exemption of the Clergy: The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> claiming to <note place="margin">

As the moſt excellent form of Government in our Kingdom moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly and bountifully protects the Church, ſo the Church doth all ſhe can to acknowledg the favour by aſſerting our <hi>Monarchy;</hi> which is but truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in <hi>Canon</hi> 1. 1640. if we through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider the ſame. Since then there hath been ſpread abroad an Inſinuation, that the ſaid Canon did immoderately extol the Divine Right of Kings, as if no other Form but Monarchy could in other States be lawful, or of God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, becauſe the Canon ſaith, <hi>The moſt High and ſacred Order of Kings is of Divine Right:</hi> I may have leave to vindicate the ſame with all ſubmiſſion where it is due.</p>

when ſeveral of his Subjects of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal profeſſion, offered by Oaths (wherein the Supremacy is wholly wav'd) to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their Duty and Obedience: the Pope and his Agents look'd upon this Overture as an Apoſtacy from him, that is, from the Chriſtian Faith, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all thoſe who were concerned in the Propoſal <note n="*" place="margin">Diff. between the Church and Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> p. 30.</note>, of which ſee the <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſial Letters,</hi> and the late Hiſtory of the <hi>Iriſh Affairs.</hi> Which moſt remarkable Story is a ſtrange proof of the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous influence on Kingdoms, which is to be expected from the propagation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith: and is alſo a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Moderation of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and how ineffectual the ſame is on ſuch.</p>
               <p>§. 8. The <hi>Rules and Orders</hi> of our Church are mildly and moderately fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: Our Church being ever moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd from the guilt or humour of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering over the Conſciences of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: She teacheth and enforceth the Divine Commands, and uſeth her Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in thoſe things which are left unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, and are within her own juſt Compaſs; The Precepts of the Church, which are very few, are juſtly affirmed
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:96474:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to bind by virtue of the Command of God; yet their Obligation (which is declared not to be Univerſal, only to her Sons, and that but ſo long as ſhe judgeth expedient) is intended or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as juſt reaſon of the Caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
               <p>No <hi>Councils Evangelical</hi> are any where made into Laws in our Church; or ſet up as a <hi>Fund</hi> for Merit and Supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but are left free for our further exerciſe and endeavour after Chriſtian Perfection: Which becauſe it cannot be thorowly attained in this imperfect ſtate, therefore the Moderation of our Church no where pretends to this perfection ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Knowledg or of Grace: So K. <hi>James</hi> affirmed to the Cardinal; <hi>He never ſhould boaſt of this Church as being perfectly without ſpot or wrinkle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 9. For Illuſtration ſake, if we would compare the moderation of our Laws, with the Laws of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, we cannot better do it than by taking into Conſideration a Chapter of <hi>Card. Bellarmine</hi>'s <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm. <hi>l. de Pontif. Ro. cap. de compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum.</hi>
                  </note>, wherein he uſeth very neat Sleights to elevate the heavineſs and number of the Pontifical Laws, and to make them fewer and lighter than were
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:96474:203"/>
the Ordinances among the <hi>Jews: For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Laws abſolutely impos'd upon all Chriſtians by our Church, are ſcarce found any more than four:</hi> viz. <hi>To obſerve the</hi> Feaſts <hi>of the Church: And the</hi> Faſts: <hi>and to</hi> Confeſs <hi>once a Year: and to</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate <hi>at Eaſter.</hi> Indeed the Men of that generation are ſo wiſe, that until any be a through Proſelyte, there is all ſhew of Moderation that may be to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice them into their Communion: But firſt, what Bondage was there ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews</hi> comparable to that one Obligation among the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Church and Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible? with the Conſequences of that in practice, which are heavier than all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Obſervances ſet together. 2ly. On the Suppoſition that there were only thoſe four general Precepts of the Church, we may conſider how great Burdens any one of them ſingly do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: 1. In that their <hi>Feaſts</hi> are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive in their number, and the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of them have ſo many Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>(V.

In that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular Confeſſion of all Mortal Sins, with all their Circumſtances, is enjoyn'd as by Divine Right <hi>(V. Ch.</hi> 11.). 4. The
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:96474:204"/>
ſlighteſt Precept of the four is the laſt, of Communicating at <hi>Eaſter:</hi> But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering therewith the round belief of Tranſubſtantiation, which all are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have, we may truly ſay with our Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi>

                  <hi>The Pope's little Finger is heavier than</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Loins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But perhaps one reaſon why the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal ſaith, there are ſo few Precepts of the Church, is becauſe he will ſay that many of the reſt are Divine Commands, as Extreme Unction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The reſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of which the Tomes of Councils and Books of Canon Law are ſo full, are not Laws, but Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions only, or pious Inſtitutions without obligation to Fault.</hi> However, there are great ſtore of them, of a great Bulk: But it is ſtrange that ſo many Canons of Councils, and other Laws enforced with <hi>Anathema,</hi> ſhould have no intended ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to a Fault in caſe of Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: Why were ſuch Laws made, or why were ſuch <hi>Anathemaes</hi> annexed? <hi>Or</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>They are Conditional Laws, as of Celibacy, in caſe any enter into ſacred Orders, which are not to be accounted bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome, becauſe the Law leaves them to their choice; as alſo in caſe of Vows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How many and how ſtrict obſervances
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:96474:204"/>
are contained under ſuch conditional Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, is too well known to be large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſiſted on. The Purifications, the choice of Meats among the <hi>Jews,</hi> had not all of them comparably ſo many Rites, and Orders, and Laws, as the Pontifical Oeconomy hath. But to make the Precepts of the Church ſhow very light and eaſie indeed, <hi>The four Laws of the Church</hi> (ſaith Bellarmin) <hi>are rather a determination of the Divine Law, than any new Law; for by the Divine Law, we are bound to dedicate ſome time to the Worſhip of God; ſometimes to Faſt, to Confeſs, to Communicate.</hi> True indeed: But then the general Rules of Scripture, the edification of Chriſtian People, the practice of the Primitive Church, the ends of Religious Actions themſelves, ought to give meaſure to Laws, (as in the Church of <hi>England</hi> is practiſed) and not to let their Commands run out into ſuch laviſh extremity, where God hath left us at ſo large and ſafe freedom. Laſtly, he ſaith, <hi>The Commands of the Church have a moſt moderate Obligation: for in their Faſts thoſe who are Sick and Aged are accepted: And for Feſtivals, their obſervation alſo is diſpenſed with up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a juſt Cauſe.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:96474:205"/>
So that in concluſion the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the moſt moderate Governour that ever was, for there it is the eaſieſt matter to get off from the ſtricteſt Precepts that are, if you have Money, but the Poor cannot be comforted <note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>§. 1. AS the nature of Moderation hath been Explained. <hi>(Ch.</hi> 1.) The moſt proper Inſtances thereof are ſuch, as ſhew the <hi>Gentleneſs</hi> and <hi>Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the Church, with reference to ſuch Cenſures and Puniſhments as are uſed and approved by Her: Which is moſt neceſſary to be obſerved, becauſe the moſt general (but groundleſs) Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the Moderation of our Church hath been upon this Occaſion: Which if we truly conſider, ariſeth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from a miſtake in Judgment, that all Coercion in matter of Religion is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, or elſe from an Impreſſion, which (on the Phancy and Affection of eaſie and ſoft Diſpoſitions) hath been made, from the Complaints of ſeveral; to whom whatever looks like Penalty, is commonly irkſome and very unpleaſing,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:96474:207"/>
(eſpecially if it happens that they are guilty of the ſame) wherefore they ſeem in haſte to fly unto Religion as their Sanctuary againſt Puniſhment; as if God's Religion, and His Church had different Altars among us; therefore I doubt not but when the Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the former Miſtake is taken off, Religion and the Church will appear to have the ſame Intereſt, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Church may be fairly acknowledged.</p>
               <p>§. 2. For the diſtinct underſtanding what is right in this Caſe, we may firſt Conſider how far toward this <hi>Coercion,</hi> the Church can move of it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We cannot but acknowledg the <hi>Church</hi> as a Society eſtabliſhed by our Lord Chriſt, and (which was neceſſary to the being of a Church) had Rulers therein appointed, with Authority and Power to effect the neceſſary Ends of Government: Which could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a power of Diſcipline, to Rebuke <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Article </seg>33</label> and Cenſure, and Exclude from ſuch a Society, thoſe who will not obſerve its juſt Laws: Which proceeding was ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Apoſtolical Practice and Command with relation to Offenders;
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:96474:208"/>
and agreable to what was practiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Synagogues; the common Reaſons of which are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually the ſame: Namely, that ſuch a Community and Fellowſhip as the Church is, be maintained in Unity, Peace, and Purity (ſince without theſe no ſuch Society can ſubſiſt) and that ſuch Offenders may (if poſſible) be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and amended; who are bound to ſubmit to ſuch Cenſures, by virtue of their own firſt Conſent; which was the Condition of being admitted to partake of the Privileges of ſuch a Communion. But in that general Contempt which is caſt on Sacred things (through the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Corruption of the Age) ſince many are inſenſible of their Duty and Relation to the Church as Members; and alſo are apt to deſpiſe the Church and her Spiritual Diſcipline: Therefore the Church in a Chriſtian Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in other Circumſtances than conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alone by it ſelf, receiving thereby Defence in the exerciſe of its Power, ſo far, that many times the Chriſtian Magiſtrate is pleaſed to add (to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Cenſures of the Church, if need be) ſuch outward and ſenſible Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as may touch the Bodies, or Goods,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:96474:208"/>
or Temporal Intereſts of ſuch Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents: In ſuch a caſe the Church hath reaſon to accept of ſuch Defence, and to approve alſo and defend the ſame ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Animadverſions on Offenders, ſince they are very lawful and uſeful, and worthy a Chriſtian Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>He</hi> being appointed of God for the puniſhment of Evil-doers, and to execute Wrath on them: Since they on whom the Church rightly inflicts her Cenſures are Evil-doers, therefore ſuch alſo the more they undervalue the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church, the more juſtly are they the ſubjects of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>And ſince Offences which affront the Majeſty of Heaven are of the higheſt Nature, the more Religious a Magiſtrate is, the more care he will take to ſee ſuch Puniſhed. And ſince Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates owe that duty to God (from whom alone they receive their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Soveraignty) they are therefore eſpecially to take care of Religion; and Common Reaſon and Experience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us, This cannot be done unleſs ſuch Laws are guarded with Sanctions of Puniſhments; that ſo They may be
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:96474:209"/>
indeed a Terror to thoſe who will break the Peace and Order of the Church: Eſpecially when the Peace of the Church hath ſo great an Influence on the Peace of the Public State, or Kingdom<hi>:</hi> Which, when it is Chriſtian, the Religion of the Kingdom is the chief part of its Laws.</p>
               <p>This is the uſe of no other Power than what the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> had: And in Chriſtian Kingdoms <note n="*" place="margin">

Firſt, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ought to be ſo voluntary as Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: And indeed Religion ought to be moſt free, even the choice of our Mind, otherwiſe it cannot be our reaſonable and acceptable Service: But Penalties (ſay they) make that to be Servile, which ought to be moſt Free: To which may be Anſwered. That all Acts of Vertue are to be free likewiſe, and it is indeed more Noble to obſerve good Laws for the love of Goodneſs, than
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:96474:210"/>
the fear of Puniſhment; But ſometime <hi>Fear is the beginning of Wiſdom,</hi> and if Men will not willingly obſerve ſuch good Laws, the ſuffering Puniſhment is a leſs bondage than the ſlavery of Sin.</p>
               <p>All Chriſtian Duty ought to be free and voluntary, but if Men are voluntarily Vitious, Heretical, and Schiſmatical, the Chriſtian Magiſtrate may Act religiouſly voluntarily to Puniſh them, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wilfully do what is evil, when they might have freely Acted what was good: Which offence is the more ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated in Matters of Religion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for any to make Religion their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for irregular practices, is to turn Religion and the Church into a Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Wickedneſs: Irreligion and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies have their ſenſual baits and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which fear of puniſhment whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely prevents, and uſefully takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>

Yet we may take notice that the caſe is quite different between either Infidels or weak Chriſtians, and thoſe who have been taught the Chriſtian Religion:</p>
               <p>Who call themſelves Chriſtians, and profeſs themſelves of the Society of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: Who preſume of themſelves, that they are far above the rank of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant or weak People: When theſe
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:96474:211"/>
diſturb the common Peace of the Church, and are in danger to infect others: When the ſame diſorder in the Church hath a dangerous influence on the Peace of the Kingdom: Such from the Nature and Laws of Chriſtian Society, deſervedly come under the Cenſure of the Church, and the Puniſhment of the Civil Laws, eſpecially in a Chriſtian Kingdom. And it is a great Bleſſing if ſuch can by any means be reduced: It is but what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and what is a great work of Charity (as our Homily hath it.)</p>
               <p n="3">3. Others pretend they ought not to be puniſhed while they follow their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But (in anſwer) What if ſuch a Conſcience ſhall caſt off all Subjection, muſt therefore all Execution of Laws be unlawful? (And they may ſo do, if they will, by the ſame Reaſon). Again, What if any call that, by the awful name of Conſcience, which is their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, their falſe Judgment of things, cauſed by the irregular inclination of their wills? Shall that excuſe them from their manifeſt Chriſtian Duty?

therefore of any who are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for their Diſobedience, cannot render that Puniſhment unjuſt, when the Laws themſelves are good, and the execution of thoſe Puniſhments upon them, are according to thoſe Laws.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Many will ſay, That Counſels and gentle Inſtructions, are a ſurer and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way to prevail. And it is very true: and God forbid but they ſhould be in their due place uſed: But if they will not prevail, they are left the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, who notwithſtanding are captious of exceptions againſt their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, to juſtifie their own Schiſm. Others frequently appeal to experience of the inefficacy of Puniſhments to theſe ends; and that they rather confirm than root out the perſuaſions they ſtrike at. And this alſo may be very true, when ſuch Penalties are either executed very unconſtantly, or in exceſs, either to a degree of Injuſtice or Cruelty: And when the due ends and meaſures of Puniſhments are not obſerved: whereas moderate and ſober Puniſhments are juſtly thought proper, to awaken the minds of Offenders into due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and regard of their Duty: But none can ever reaſonably think, that
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:96474:212"/>
it will conduce to the peace of the World for any to do as they liſt. And whereas it is frequently objected: That the omiſſions of Forms and Ceremonies is more ſeverely puniſhed than greater Faults. <hi>How greater?</hi> (ſaid Biſhop <hi>Lany</hi> before the King.) <hi>Our Earthly Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals are not erected to anticipate the Day of Judgment, to try Men according to the proper meaſure of their Guilt, but for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular End and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe; therefore in ſome caſes ſuch Omiſſions are purſued with more care and ſtrictneſs, becauſe they deſtroy the very end for which the Power is given the Church to puniſh, which is the preſervation of Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi>

Sufficient ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt be mutually given againſt ſuch Principles, the profeſſing and purſuing of which neceſſarily deſtroys all Civil and Spiritual Communion: As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, That Faith is not to be kept with thoſe whom one part calls Hereticks: Or that right of Dominion one over the other is founded in Saint-ſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5. For accommodation in Peace-ſake, if theſe and the like Principles and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines be publickly and ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, then they muſt mutually take care, that the evil Conſequence of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall not be imputed to thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons who do deteſt them and acknowledg them moſt impious.</p>
               <p>This being the proper Foundation for Communion together in Doctrine, Sacraments, and Diſcipline; the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent buſineſs is to convince ſuch as will admit of the Debate, That thoſe Doctrines and Practices which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:96474:231"/>
above and beſide what are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually agreed in; do really contradict the clear Contents of the Scripture, or the Judgment of the Univerſal Church, and are not of ſafe influence on the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion: It may do well to be ſhewn by Inſtances of Fact; and the light of concurrent Tradition, when the particular Innovations entred in, by what occaſions and degrees, and the evil Conſequences of them all: Which will more effectually be performed, if it can be demonſtrated, That moſt of this is acknowledged by the many of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere amongſt themſelves, (at quiet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals.)

1. in general, with reſpect to both: That true Chriſtianity requires us to be Enemies to no one; If any will be to us, and to Truth, the blame muſt lie at their Door who give the juſt cauſe. If any require plainly ſinful conditions, indiſpenſable to hold Communion with them, in ſuch a caſe the Command holds good, <hi>Come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate.</hi> The reaſon why, in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation, Reconciliation with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> hath upon ſuch terms men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, bin ſpoken of, is becauſe; They are they who have laid the Obſtruction to all Union by their enormous Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and it lies upon them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Obſtruction; and no wonder if they be called on ſo to do: And who will not conſent to that (however hopeleſs) deſire; if they will lay aſide their Corruptions, we may be all one Sheepfold under one Shephard, Chriſt Jeſus? Concerning ſuch Projects of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which have been made long ſince by ſome of the moſt moderate of their own Communion, and ſome other Learned Men amongſt Proteſtants: Of which <hi>Caſſander</hi>'s Conſultation <note n="*" place="margin">

and famous: Of theſe this may ſafely be ſaid, (whether and to what degrees their Deſigns be approved or condemned, however) they have given abundant Proofs, wherein the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at preſent appears the more irreconcileable, the more ſhe is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to all ſuch terms of Reconciliation which they have diſcourſed. If ſome other Diſcourſes have bin at any time made by any of our Communion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to ſuch Reconciliation with ſome Romaniſts, they may be lookt upon only as ſuch Suppoſitions as have bin among Learned Men generally diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, thereby the more clearly to ſhow the unreaſonableneſs of the Romiſh Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours. But what-ever may be propoſed as a meer Speculation; the vanity of concluding upon any ſuch Union as likely may appear from the Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which are ſuch, if we take away her Corruptions, we take away Popery it ſelf. Yet it muſt be acknowledged, the Art of the <hi>Romaniſt,</hi> even in ſuch ſeeming Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, is very notorious, to gain ſuch Points for themſelves, as may ſerve their preſent turns, and may make afterwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for the confirmation of their own
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:96474:234"/>
Rigours. But, (whatſoever ſome few among them promiſe) what ſhould be conſented to by them, is like an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by a Minor, which is void, as the Tutor and Governour ſhall pleaſe: for we know, not only what the nature of their Gifts are, but alſo how they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and return Conceſſions and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences: Wherefore ſuch Propoſals from any of our Communion are the more needleſs; becauſe the Principles of our Reformation are already ſo prudent and moderate.</p>
               <p>As to ſome who have ſuſpected an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination in thoſe of our Communion, to pacification rather with the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> than with them: We Anſwer,</p>
               <p>1. This is the nature of Aemulous Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be always thus jealous of any ſorts of Communication with their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries; but ſo long as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and <hi>Sectaries</hi> have had the ſame kind of jealouſy of the ſame ſorts of Perſons, it is but a good proof of the real Moderation of our Church, and of thoſe of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, in oppoſition to all undue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams. Neither ought it to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Indifference, Neutrality and Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs, but impartial conſtancy to ſuch Truth as is eſpouſed for her own
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:96474:234"/>
ſake. Sometime that jealouſy hath bin raiſed of deſign to make the indiſcreet ſort of Men among us, the more out of charity with our Church: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it will be made out, <hi>(Ch.</hi> 17. §. 7.) that thoſe who conform to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> do not agree with the Papiſts ſo really as our Diſſenters do. Our diſſenting Brethren often forget what hath bin performed by our Church in oppoſition to the Romiſh Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Errors, and alſo for the ſake of themſelves: They forget how often their Jealouſies have proved groundleſs and untrue: And it would do well, for the time to come, if the ſincere among them would ſet down, in ſome place by it ſelf, ſuch jealouſies of theirs; and in the next Column (over againſt) would remark their own frequent miſtakes. Such forget alſo, or ſeem never to have known, how our Reformation hath bin approved of by the beſt Proteſtants: And whereas they ſeem to pity the firſt Reformers, as Men but half ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned as themſelves, who look upon the Moderation of our Church, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the firſt crepuſcular and duskiſh Light of thoſe Times; in this Matter they ſpeak like thoſe who have
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:96474:235"/>
received ſome Traditions at ſecond-hand from <hi>Cartwright,</hi> but never compar'd his Writings with Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whitgift:</hi> and as they do not ſeem to conſider the full knowledg and conſideration which our Reformers had of the Principles and Abuſes of Popery: and the diligent eye they had alſo to ſuch other Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as before ours had their perfection; ſo they do not conſider that our preſent Eſtabliſhment was conſtituted with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our Proteſtants of the greateſt averſation from <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is much to be feared, that thoſe that clamour moſt of us for pacification with the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſo little underſtand what they would have, that becauſe the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> hold (as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſheweth) <note place="margin">Reformed Catholic.</note> 
                  <hi>the ſame neceſſary Heads of Religion with us,</hi> they ſeem willing and contented we ſhould renounce ſundry Articles of our Creed, that we may be ſure not to agree with them. And this is ſpoken upon good grounds, for many of our Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Diſſenters, as they are called, do (as it is too well known) not by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence only, but in direct terms, deny many, (I may ſay of theſe few) firſt Fundamental Verities of Common Chriſtianity (as, 'tis a ſad thing to ſay it
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:96474:235"/>
may be ſhewn at large); and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, what kindneſs! what friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip! what Correſpondence is practiſed and encouraged by them daily with theſe Friends? who are leſs ſuſpected or reviled, than the true and firm Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas they commonly ſay, That the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the chief of Her Communion, are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to allow any Pacification with, or Conceſſions to Proteſtant Diſſenters, as may be reaſonable for public Concord. We Anſwer;</p>
               <p>1. They are utterly miſtaken in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo; for beſide that, the conditions of Communion with our Church are very equal and juſt. We may preſume to ſay alſo, from what our Church hath done, and hath declared She is willing to do; and from the diſpoſition of Her Communion, there is no doubt but our Church would gladly (in ſuch things as ſhe might) remit of what ſhe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth otherwiſe expedient; for the ends of Peace and Univerſal Concord, if ſhe could be aſſured any reaſonable Conceſſions ſhould have that effect, as might ſuit with the true Honour of God, and the real good of the Church.</p>
               <p>

Uniformity in Religious and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Matters ſure is ſo excellent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable a gain, that certainly an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſomewhat leſs perfect; with <hi>being of the ſame mind ſo far as we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,</hi> and with a regular and effectual obſervation of good Laws, is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible, than an appointment in ſome Circumſtances more perfect, without the ſame uniform order and peace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: But how unequal is it, that they ſhould be the only Arbiters and Judges of Union, who not only are great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of our Diſſention, but are at ſuch great diſagreements among themſelves, <hi>(V.

ſelf (as is the Church) a Society di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and by her Cenſures doth ſeparate from thoſe that are inordinate: and in her own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence keeps her ſelf from complying with ſinful and unjuſt conditions of Communion: Yet with the whole Church throughout the World, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part thereof, (to whom her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is not diſpleaſing) Our Church in deſire and endeavour, doth maintain all inward and outward agreement ſhe can <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Juſt Grounds;</hi> Under which head I ſhall not take too large a compaſs to illuſtrate the Moderation of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, either from the manifold Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations and Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time; nor from the invidious task of looking into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Rigors of any other Models of Reformation: Neither is it here neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to reflect more particularly on Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact hiſtorically relating here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, which have bin copiouſly ſet forth by a multitude of Writers, both Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical and Civil, which abundantly juſtify this Reformation both in its Cauſes and Proceedings, clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting how this Church was juſtified therein, from the unjuſt conditions of Communion, which the Church of

                  <hi>Rome</hi> peremptorily inſiſted upon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it might have <hi>Juſt Authority,</hi> the ſaid Reformation was manag'd by the Guides and Governors of the Church; and was confirmed by Supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſo in every particular was as legal as any Reformation could or ought to be; as doth ſufficiently appear from Matter of Fact recounted in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Monuments thereof; <hi>Wherein the Princes acted their parts, and the Clergie theirs; they calling together the Biſhops and others of the Clergie to conſider of what might ſeem worthy Reformation; and the Clergie did their part; for being called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by Regal Power, they met in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Synod of</hi> 62, <hi>and the Articles were agreed on, and were afterward confirmed by Acts of State, and Royal Aſſent</hi>

               <p>Any Reformation otherwiſe than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, is as much againſt the Principles of our Church as any one can wiſh; and had the Doctrine of our Homilies bin well regarded, it might have prevented much miſchief conſequent on later Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations: <hi>Leſt any Perſons, upon colour of deſtroying Images, make any ſtir or diſturbance in the Common-Wealth, it muſt always be remembred, that the redreſs of ſuch public Enormities pertaineth to the</hi>

               </p>
               <p>In purſuance of theſe ſincere deſigns of Piety, Truth, Peace, and Order, the Moderation of our Church in her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, will the more certainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear founded in Juſtice. If we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Church hath not made Truth to ſubmit to her Authority, but hath chearfully and ſincerely ſubmitted her ſelf to Truth: She hath not had a weight and a weight, to buy the Truth by one, and to ſell it by another; but hath judged of all Truth, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of its neceſſity, by the Standard which God hath given his Church, namely, the Holy Scriptures, the only Rule of her Faith: So in rejection of Error, our Church hath bin impartial to either extreme.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Church holds no ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines as neceſſarily or by conſequence overthrow a good Life, and the practice of Devotion: For this we muſt ſay for the Conſtitution of our Church, The Vices among us are in no wiſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of our Doctrines: Neither have we any ſuch Moderation among
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:96474:254"/>
us, to reconcile the pleaſures and profits of Sin, with the hope of happineſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, ſubjecting the moſt divine things, to moſt vile purpoſes; which tends to make the World believe, that Chriſtian Religion is a cheat, and its Prieſts the moſt vile Impoſters of any. Whatever the ſcandalous opinions and practices of the Adverſaries of our Church have done, to the great hindrance of the converſion of many, and the injury of Chriſtianity; Our Church of <hi>England</hi> gives no offence to <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Greek, Mahumetan</hi> or <hi>Heathen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Our Church hath not ſquared the frame of its Eccleſiaſtical Policy, by the ends of Secular Grandure, or external Pomp, as if ſhe could put off Chriſtianity to put on worldly Glory: and as if we believed in ſuch a <hi>Meſſias</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> expected, rather than in the crucified Jeſus, whoſe Kingdom is not of this World. And here, rather than ſtay the Reader too long, I commit to his refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, how the peculiar Doctrines of the Roman Church, tend to the encreaſe of their Power, or their Patrimony, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Non eſt amplius Eccleſia, ſed Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publica quaedam humana, ſub Papa Monarchiâ temporali.</hi> Spalatenſis <hi>in. profect. Conſil.</hi>

                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:96474:255"/>
Here might properly be conſidered, the intolerable Charge which the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Church juſtly ſaves us, in that expence which unjuſtly follows Popery. The one Doctrine of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, will coſt any one very dear upon the belief of it. How many Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, Maſſes, Jubilees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be paid for? <note n="¶" place="margin">

               <p n="4">4. Our Church by its Moderation, hath been far from driving on any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt deſigns. Whereas the Moderation of the Romiſh Church, hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways noted very artificial. Whence they have moderate explications for the doubtful Indulgences, for the ſoft Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities, for the ſoure Legends, for the credulous Viſions, for the Enthuſiaſt, fair interpretations for what may ſeem harſh; a mild ſence for their turn, and a ſtrict ſenſe alſo to keep up the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Church; fair and goodly Baits to entangle Proſelytes, but when they are engaged, they may find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves caught with a bearded Hook. Even ſuch ſometime is the ſeeming Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Self-denial which is che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:96474:255"/>
in our Sectaries, by thoſe who actuate them: that ſo they may more effectually divide, and propagate ſuch Diviſion. Whereas, thoſe who are truly principled, according to the Moderation of our Church, are made to be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and conſiſtent to themſelves, and to Truth; not to turn to one hand of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, nor to the other hand of Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm, in any ſinful compliance; which rather than admit (if the caſe requires) they can ſuffer Martyrdom, as did ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of the firſt Compilers of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer-book, and many ſince (even in the late times), and all kinds of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings beſide.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Moderation alſo of our Church in its Reformation thus founded in Juſtice, hath cauſed her to avoid ſuch Corruptions, as render the Sincerity of others very doubtful. We have not by Arts and deviſed Subtilties, gone about to palliate, nor by Power and Authority to uphold any Errors whatſoever; nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted Eccleſiaſtical Policy, by gratifying the corrupt inclinations of Men: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Doctrines nor Policy of our Church are kept up by pious or impious Frauds, equivocations of Oaths, falſe Miracles, pretended Revelations, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:96474:256"/>
Reliques, Forgeries and Expurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Books, devotional Ignorance, exquiſite Arts of defaming our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſometime extream Cruelty: This Juſtice in which the Moderation of our Church is founded, makes thoſe of our Church careful to take, and heedful to keep our Oaths and Vows, whereas among the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> eaſy diſpenſations diſſolve thoſe ſacred Bands of Society. <hi>What think we</hi> (ſaith our Homily of good works) <note n="¶" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>According to the ſame principle of Juſtice governing our Church, the forms and practices of our Church do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict our general Rules of Faith; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we believe in the Holy Trinity, therefore we do not worſhip Saints and Angels; becauſe we believe the Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church, therefore we believe not in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>§. 1. NOtwithſtanding our Church of <hi>England</hi> hath bin by the moſt wiſe and Learned Men, Foreign
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:96474:259"/>
and Domeſtic, acknowledged the very excellent part of the Reformation; yet how often hath ſhe bin reproached with moſt unjuſt Cenſures of undue compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with Popery? It being one of the known Policies of the Romiſh Factors, to cauſe their Agents among our ſelves (whom they uſe for the overthrow of our Church) to cry out <hi>Popery,</hi> at the ſame time they moſt of all ſerve the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Intereſt themſelves. Wherefore that the Romaniſts may uſe the Separatiſts with the more unperceivable diſguiſe and ſucceſs, to undermine our Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, theſe alſo have bin inſpired to blaſt with the Name of <hi>Popery,</hi> what is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed in our Church. Hence is it, that the Writings and private Inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of Diſſenters are full of this Charge, in a joint deſign to diſgrace our Communion, and to exaſperate other Proteſtants againſt us: Some of thoſe Exceptors running to ſuch an exceſs of Rigour, as to count <hi>Churches, Bells, God-fathers, Churching of Women, Burial-Service,</hi> the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> to come under the name of <hi>Popery:</hi> Altho by no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was it ever made to appear, That our Church agrees with the Romaniſt in any thing contrary to Scripture, and
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:96474:260"/>
the practice of the Primitive Church: As ſhe is truly alſo moſt remov'd from <hi>Fanaticiſm;</hi> neither uſing nor encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging any Enthuſiaſtic way of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor allowing any reſiſting of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority under any Religious Pretences whatſoever. Any one may be convinced, that no formed Church in the Chriſtian World is more truly Proteſtant than is the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor any which (all things compared) leſs compromiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with <hi>Rome.</hi> If they will but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in our Articles, Liturgy, Canons, Conſtitutions, Practice, Oaths of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how firmly our Church preſerves and enforceth the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Yea, the <hi>Canons</hi> of 1640, did excellently take care for the ſuppreſſing <hi>the growth of Popery,</hi> (Canon. 3. 6.) <hi>and alſo of Socinianiſm,</hi> Canon 4. Which Seeds of Socinianiſm have bin ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered amongſt our Sectaries, and have of late had great growth amongſt them: Yet nevertheleſs if ſuch Friends as they ſhould ſlip into greater Hereſy, ſo long as they are with them in the Schiſm, there is a ſpecial reſpect due to them, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to the cloſe adherents of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> who becauſe they run not into the madneſs of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:96474:260"/>
and are not outragious too in that madneſs, they are forward to cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour againſt our Church it ſelf as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh, and turn their own ſilly Surmiſes into powerful Calumnies. Neither do thoſe who reproach our Conſtitution, ſufficiently call to mind what hath bin done all along ſince the Reformation, by our Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and the great Councils of the Kingdom, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church, and the Induſtry of our Biſhops, for the ſuppreſſion of the growth of Popery.</p>
               <p>§. 2. But as a ſufficient Evidence that our Church (according to its eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) doth in no ſort favour Popery; They muſt be very diſingenuous and wanting to Truth, who will not readily acknowledg that the Labours of our <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> and our Conformable Clergy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the moſt impregnable defence of the Reformation.</p>
               <p>For who, I pray, have more ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and conſtantly oppoſed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations and immoderate Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> than our <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and the Learned Men in firm Communion with our Church, even ſince Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s days, (when ſome
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:96474:261"/>
were Martyrs and Confeſſors) and whoſe Writings but theirs, who have held firm Communion with our Church, remain as the conſtant Bullwark of our Proteſtant Reformation? Wherefore the Romaniſts keeneſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>State hath bin ſo much diſturbed: It is her Truth and Peace, her Decency and Order, which they labour to undermine and purſue with ſo reſtleſs a malice: And ſince they do ſo, it will be neceſſary for us to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between Popiſh and other Recuſants; between them that would deſtroy the whole Flock, and them that only wander from it.</hi>

                  <pb n="461" facs="tcp:96474:261"/>
As for thoſe of our Separatiſts who have ſometimes menaged Debates with the Romaniſts, the cunning Adverſary commonly lets them alone: for how <hi>ſeldom</hi> do we ſee a Romaniſt write againſt or oppoſe a Nonconformiſt, and be in much earneſt againſt him? Not merely becauſe he thinks ſuch inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, but becauſe theſe are doing their Work for them as faſt as they can <note n="*" place="margin">Hoc Itha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>§. 3. Wherefore thoſe of the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration who have bin concerned in theſe Clamours and Surmiſes of our Church favouring Popery, have acted, therein as appears, firſt, very falſly, and then very imprudently, in reproaching ſo excellent a Reformation, and by join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with them in their oppoſing our Church, they ſtrengthen the hands of the Romaniſts whom they pretend to oppoſe, to the great ſcandal of the Chriſtian Religion, and great miſchief to the true Proteſtant Intereſt: Which cauſed Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> (in his Epiſtle to

§. 5. But before we enter upon this undertaking, to ſhew how thoſe who are in ſeparation from our Church do really conſpire with the Romaniſts. To prevent any miſtake, let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred;</p>
               <p>Firſt, That we do not deny that moſt of our Diſſenters do openly demonſtrate a very zealous and undoubted abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Popery; their real purpoſe in which is not here queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, but believed: <note n="*" place="margin">

Rigid Profeſſors <hi>on either ſide have quite leaped over the</hi> Mean, <hi>and have bin</hi> rigid <hi>the other way, as</hi> Extremity <hi>it ſelf—and is a very natural motion. For a Man is apt to think he can never run far enough from that which he once begins to hate.</hi> Of which ſort the ſeveral Factions and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts among us have bin continually like the Friars at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> who were always watchful and zealous to maintain their peculiar Doctrines: among which extremes, our Church (if ſhe might be liſtened to) would reduce all to a due temper, upon ſurer and more reaſonable Foundations, than the Biſhops at that Council laboured to do.</p>
               <p>3. As our Laws by one name call both ſorts of Separatiſts, <hi>Recuſants;</hi> ſo our Romaniſts and Sectaries behave themſelves much alike: The one have their private Maſſes, the other their Conventicles, both contrary to the Laws of our Kingdom and our Church: Both the Romaniſts and the Separatiſts join in requiring a Licenſe for the Exerciſe of their Religion in private Houſes.</p>
               <p>4. Both our Romaniſts and Sectaries by encreaſing our Diviſions, help with joint force to make a general <hi>Toleration</hi> neceſſary, which would give the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:96474:266"/>
the greateſt advantage they can deſire.</p>
               <p>They both ſupplicate with equal ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs to be tolerated, whereas the Principles of each lead them not to tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate others.</p>
               <p>5. Their pretences to all mildneſs and gentleneſs, are equally ſupple and aſſuring: but how mild they are when they are uppermoſt, odious experience teſtifies, ſo that Inſtances of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Rigors, which are moſt known, need not be enumerated. We need not call on the Inquiſition to teſtify to the Rigors of the Romaniſts, nor look into all the Severities of the <hi>Diſciplinarians,</hi> who have bin known to inflict Cenſures for a ſuſpicion of Covetouſneſs, a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity in Raiment, for dancing at a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for uſing their Liberty in their Recreations; and have kept others (as well as themſelves) from the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper upon uncharitable Accounts. It hath bin obſerved, where the Diſcipline in <hi>Scotland</hi> was eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the People had a high Commiſſion in every Pariſh, and groan'd under the Arbitrary Decrees of Ignorant Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors: If there aroſe a private Jar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Parent and the Child, the

Huſband and the Wife, theſe Domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Judges muſt know it. Formerly and lately among ſome, they have bin ſcarce allowed in Conſcience to marry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the <hi>Teacher:</hi> or when they have, it hath bin matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</p>
               <p>6. It hath bin already obſerved at large, <hi>(Chap.</hi> 13. §. 58.) how both the Romaniſts and the Separatiſts agree in their groundleſs and unjuſt accuſing the Government of <hi>Perſecution:</hi> like the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> of old, who cried out <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> when they moſt of all had affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Catholics.</p>
               <p>The Romaniſts have their dire <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's</hi> and heavy Cenſures; the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts their cruel <hi>Maranatha's;</hi> and preach Damnation moſt of all againſt them that differ from them, eſpecially if they be of the Church's ſide.</p>
               <p>7. Nevertheleſs both ſorts can very eaſily give out <hi>Indulgences</hi> to their own Parties. God ſees no ſin in his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſay ſome Sectaries: Which is a greater Bribe to be of their Party, than any can be found in the Penitentiary Tax, for Sins as they are ſold at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. When the Papiſts and the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts have bin at a loſs, that they cannot
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:96474:267"/>
juſtify their Proceedings by the Laws of God or Man, then they meet in one common Sanctuary, whereby they are bold to ſanctify the moſt extravagant Practices; pretending <hi>Providence</hi> for their Warrant. Thus Pope <hi>Pius</hi> 5. in his Speech in the Conſiſtory of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals at <hi>Rome,</hi> after the murder of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. of <hi>France,</hi> ſundry times, in one Oration, he magnifies the Exploit of that wretched Zealot, as brought about by the ſpecial <hi>Providence</hi> of God <note n="*" place="margin">Non niſi Dei opt.

The ſame impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or ignorance others have uſed to defend ſuch Practices as no Laws, Divine or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, could juſtify, ſheltring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wide pretence of <hi>Providence;</hi> which hath bin well call'd, <note n="†" place="margin">Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi> p. 16. <hi>Regiment politicum fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur in extraordinarià Dei Providentiâ.

                  <hi>A fine pliable Principle, it will lap about your finger like Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. The Romaniſts enlarge their Creed in ſundry Articles, (without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of which there is no Salvation) and very many Separatiſts deliver their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Doctrines as abſolutely neceſſary to a ſtate of Salvation, (tho among the divided Sects many of them are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to another.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="474" facs="tcp:96474:268"/>
They both often ſtuff their Prayers and their Chatechiſms with Matters of doubtful Controverſy; and in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſame, they are alike too dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical.</p>
               <p>10. We need not here prove what is ſo well known, namely, the mean Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which the Romaniſts have of Holy Scriptures, ſuppoſing they receive their Authority from the Pope, yet receiving their own Traditions with equal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reverence. The Separatiſts, by caſting off (to another extreme) the real Authority and Teſtimony of God's Church (which hath bin all along the Keeper, the Witneſs, the Defender, the Interpreter of Holy Scriptures) by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees many of our Separatiſts have come to throw off the Holy Scriptures as a Rule of Faith and Manners. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts they add their own Traditions to the Word of God; and many Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries call their Teaching, and their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes, the Word of God, which often is quite contrary thereunto.</p>
               <p>The Romaniſts ſet up the Pope for an Infallible Interpreter; many of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts account the Private Spirit an Infallible Interpreter. <hi>V. Ch.</hi> 4. §. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="475" facs="tcp:96474:268"/>
11. The Romaniſts pretend that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and extraordinary Gifts have not ceaſed, but are ſtill neceſſary Signs of a true Church. It is alſo the very height of Enthuſiam to hold as many of our Separatiſts do, That Immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from God, and extraordinary Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes from the Holy Spirit, are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and common among all the Faithful.</p>
               <p>Which Pretences lying obvious to an eaſy Confidence, cannot eaſily be wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted from ſuch as will hold them to their own deſtruction.</p>
               <p>12. The Romaniſts aſſert an implicit Faith which is determinately reſolved into the authority of their Leaders: Whether the like is ever required by the Leaders generally of Factions among us, I do not now enquire: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that the ſame is granted by their Followers appears moſt evident; For when many can give no reaſon for what they hold, they keep cloſe to their Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders, and move and change with them generally; and how much the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Perſons they have in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, governs them, more than any ſway of Argument, is daily experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. And whereas a due regard on this ſide, the implicit Faith of the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:96474:269"/>
is due to Governors, <hi>V. Ch.</hi> 6. §. 9, 10. toward ſuch, how ſcrupulous, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and wary are they, (not to ſay diſregardful); but in following their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Factions, how prone are they, and ſequacious.</p>
               <p>13. Both the Romaniſts and Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (to ſerve their turn upon occaſion) caſt off the uſe of Reaſon, wherein God hath made it a Guide: Therefore they both reproach our Faith as a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, probable, natural, fallible Faith; the one becauſe we will not receive Oral Tradition, and the like Uncertainties; the other, becauſe we do not think an immediate extraordinary teſtimony of the Spirit neceſſary to aſſure us of the certainty we have of our Faith, of the Truth of Holy Scriptures; to afford us alſo our words in Prayer, and the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Salvation.</p>
               <p>14. The <hi>Superſtitions</hi> of the Papiſts are notorious, and alſo of our Sectaries; and ſo many, they are not here to be numbred. If Superſtition be going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all meaſure, their humour is to keep no Meaſure nor order, but to heap one ſuperfluous thing upon another; and then they think God is pleaſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are: Many of them account
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:96474:269"/>
it a ſign of Grace, and the favour of God, and matter of greateſt Conſcience, not to hear or uſe Common Prayers, nor any decent Rite or Practice required by the Church.</p>
               <p>The Romaniſts invoke Saints of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Sanctity: Many of the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts call thoſe of their own Party the only Saints, and judg them to have the right to judg the World, and in the mean time to rule it; if they cannot do that, they muſt cenſure what is done by others.</p>
               <p>15. The Romaniſts and our Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts are very much the ſame in their <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Humour, (deſcribed at large, and reprehended by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 4.) To name only, <hi>Their binding heavy Burdens and grievous to be born, and laying them on Mens ſhoulders.</hi> As the Romaniſts add twelve Articles to their Creed; a wondrous number of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to their ſeven Sacraments: Not to mention more of their loads of Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; their Feſtivals; their Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Confeſſion; their Vows; their Scourgings, and Faſtings, and Penances which they lay upon the Poor; when the Impoſers do not touch them with one of their fingers, or with wetting
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:96474:270"/>
the leaſt of them, they can get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an eaſy Diſpenſation. Doth not the ſame <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Spirit poſſeſs many, who make the Peace of the World, and the Church, depend upon their peculiar Doctrines? Who make all they can, think it a ſin to come to Common-Prayer; to kneel at the Sacrament; to be Baptized according to Order of the Church; to pray in a Form; to wear a Surplice: Inſtead of making broad their <hi>Philacteries,</hi> and enlarging the Frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their Garments, they have had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Superſtition, in wearing their Hair in a preciſe cut, (ſomewhat like the tonſures of the Romaniſts); ſome will not wear a Riband: Others not Starch in their Bands, nor pull off their Hat.</p>
               <p>16. The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> makes the Intention of the Prieſt neceſſary to the Sacraments: Many of the Separation make the Spiritual Grace of the Miniſter abſolutely neceſſary for the Peoples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving benefit from the ſame.</p>
               <p>17. Both the Romaniſts and the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts uſe much the ſame kind of Arts to blaſt their Adverſaries: The Romaniſts have their <hi>Legends and Fables;</hi> juſt ſo our Separatiſts love to pick up Stories of
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:96474:270"/>
Biſhops and the Clergy, and to patch them together in enmity to our Church; with theſe they keep up the humour of the People who entertain them with good things.

                     <hi>V.</hi> C. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavicini <hi>Hiſt. Conc.</hi> Trid. l. 1. c. 25.</note>): Then it will follow that the Pope cannot diſpoſe of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to their Juriſdictions; and then
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:96474:271"/>
the Pope may be oppoſed by theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, which may be a ready way to overthrow the Papacy. So that the Controverſy, who hath the Juriſdiction which belongs to Biſhops in common, nay, who have ſuch Juriſdiction by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, is driven between the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who challeng it to the Pope, and other Conſiſtories among us in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion from our Church.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in oppoſition to Biſhops, the higheſt Papalins talk moſt of the Sovereign Power of the People, becauſe they hold the Intereſt of the Pope to be upheld by their veneration. And by the Intereſt of the Jeſuits for many years of late, the Popiſh Faction in <hi>England</hi> have bin with-held from having any Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Biſhops. And moſt of our Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts would be glad there were no other; thus in their oppoſition to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops they agree.</p>
               <p>19. Both the Romaniſts and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts extreamly agree in their Principles againſt the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate.</hi> According to that of Biſhop <hi>Lany</hi>

Both the Papiſts and the others infringe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the King in Eccleſiaſtical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters within his own Dominions: Both deny the Right of Kings to call Synods and Eccleſiaſtical Convocations: Both hold that Kings may be put out of all Eccleſiaſtical Communion: Both deny the Supremacy of the King; one attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes it to the Pope originally, the other to the People.

               <p>20.

Their very Diviſions, how do they alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the minds of Chriſtians one from another? Tho they ought to belong to the ſame moderate Church, are Subjects of the ſame moſt Gracious King, are of the ſame Proteſtant and Reformed Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, beſide the danger they bring to themſelves and their Families, by their pernicious and deſtructive Separation, ſo many and more might be the Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their looſing the Bonds of Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Duty.</p>
               <p>§. 8. Among other Sects, it would grieve any one to behold ſo many ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:96474:273"/>
into the ſilly Herd of <hi>Quakers;</hi> a Sect into which the very dregs of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and Schiſm ſeem to have bin drein'd, as it were, into one Common Shore: In the inventing and propagating which, even Satan and the Jeſuit ſeem to have club'd their utmoſt Art; poſſeſſing them with an evil Spirit of Deluſion, which they call the <hi>Light within them;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which, what is moſt contrary to Holy Scriptures, and Right Reaſon; and the teſtimony and judgment of the whole Church, and the prudent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Governors, and the ſence and cuſtom of wiſe and pious Men, muſt paſs for an extraordinary illumination from God, merely on the credit of their own ſaying ſo.</p>
               <p>This one Enthuſiaſtical Conceit of the <hi>Light within,</hi> and Opinion of ſuch Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from God, is the moſt unhappy contrivance and ſuggeſtion that can be, to lift up ſilly People above a poſſibility of being contradicted, by any ſober Principles of Scripture, or Reaſon, or regular Authority; fitted to poſſeſs ſuch with a luſty pride, and bewitched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of themſelves; an incorrigible mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſeneſs, and obſtinacy; an intolerable cenſoriouſneſs, a ſordid ſcorn of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:96474:273" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is in juſt place above them: and wonderfully diſpoſeth ſuch for Popery; for when once they are ſufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from our Church, the Work is ſufficiently done. Then if any arch-Emiſſary from <hi>Rome,</hi> will come with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Revelations, and a ſhew of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Authority; and humor this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtill in their outragious clamours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Church: eſpecially if they will fall a quaking and groaning intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, and appear in the Streets, as ſome have done, ſoundly be-dunged with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny and Filth, ſuch may make ſome People believe any Romiſh Tenets as Revelations from God.</p>
               <p>That they have bin wrought and acted unto this by the common Authors of our Diviſions, is ſuch plain atteſted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, that I ſuppoſe few conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Perſons queſtion it. Some long ſince took notice, that in the Northern Parts (where there abounded moſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſts and Recuſants) there this upſtart Sect of <hi>Quakers</hi> firſt ſprung up; ſending thence their Emiſſaries two by two into other quarters of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, (as the unclean Beaſts entred the Ark by Couples): beſide which, many Reaſons confirm the ſame.</p>

               </p>

6. By refuſing all Oaths, their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is left uncertain to the King, which is the main thing ſuch Papiſts would have.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The King's Supremacy is left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledged, which is another prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal preparation for the owning of the Pope's Supremacy.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In that they refuſe to aſſiſt their Prince in his Wars, and pretend they hold it unlawful for any to fight: By that Principle they not only take away the Power and Sword of the Magiſtrate, and leave the King and Country unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, that none can live in peace and ſafety, and conſequently that Opinion leads to overthrow the very being of the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>But the Pope alſo ſerves his Deſign by them, being ſure that ſo many as there are of that Sect, ſo many will never op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him by Arms: Whereas they who bind, can alſo looſe; and the ſame Agent can be able to ſtir up their Spirit of Zeal alſo, (which the longer it hath bin contained, will be the more furious) a <hi>Specimen</hi> and taſte of which fury, we experience in the keen violence of their Tongues, which are as a <hi>very ſharp Sword,</hi> upon ſundry ſlight occaſions.</p>

Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> in their pretences to all mortification of Spirit and mildneſs. In their pretences to extraordinary and miraculous Gifts; in their many kinds of Superſtitions, and Phariſaicalneſs; in their clamours alſo of Perſecution; in their grievous <hi>Anathema's</hi> and Curſes they uſe againſt us, too like the Roman Curſes, by Bell, Book, and Candle; which ſheweth what is the <hi>Light within them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§. 9. It might be no difficult thing to ſhew ſome of thoſe ſteps and degrees by which ſome commonly advance to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who ſeparate from Communion with our Church.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſtep to Diviſion is, When what is amiſs in Government and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, (in Church or State) is ſet forth to the full advantage of diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as may make withal the moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable out-cry that may be: unto which there ſhall never be wanting arch and cunning Inſtruments, who by all plauſible means ſhall ſtir up the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and Paſſions, and Zeal of the People under ſuch pretences, as ſhall moſt inflame and excite them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="490" facs="tcp:96474:276"/>
Then in the next place are made ſuch immoderate pretences to Purity, and profeſſion of Saintſhip, as when poor ſimple People experience upon trial the ſame to be falſe, and not to anſwer their expectation, they run and ſeek from one Sect to another, till they come to be Quakers, and ſo (as we ſee) in the next preparation to Popery.</p>
               <p>3. Having thus caſt off all Forms as dangerous and unlawful, being raiſed to expect every-where the effects of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit extraordinary, they are made ſo En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtical, 'tis hard to contain them within ordinary bounds, till they arrive at the perfection of Enthuſiaſm, <hi>the Light within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. By the way we muſt note, there is no one Principle which hath bin the Original of all this Enthuſiaſm and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, more than that, <hi>Nothing is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be done, but for which there is an expreſs Example or Precept in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which attributing to the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that Perfection which is beſide the end of them, doth tend, by conſequence, to take away the true perfection of them which they have, (which hath bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in the <hi>4th</hi> Chapter) which hath
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:96474:276"/>
bin found true: for all theſe ſub-diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sects, have tended in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to caſt off Holy Scripture as a Rule. By the conſequences of this Principle, is come to paſs what Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and <hi>Hooker,</hi> and others foretold; <hi>If Puritaniſm ſhould prevail, it would ſoon draw in Anabaptiſm.</hi> From them we have had <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Seekers,</hi> and other Sects, which divide us, and are ready to deſtroy us, and to bring in Popery, as it were, at the back door: <hi>I may not diſſemble my own fears,</hi> (ſaith Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi>

Who make uſe of our Diviſions to cry up alſo the neceſſity of an Infallible Judg of Controverſy.</p>
               <p>The Infallible private Spirit, is a fair preparation thereunto: and when they have broken and diſcredited the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Church, they have that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, which gives them moſt hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and oppoſition.</p>

§. 11. Unto all this, if any object, and tell us of the Advice of Cardinal <hi>Allen</hi> to the Perſons who undertook to reduce <hi>Ireland</hi> again to Popery:—Among other things they ſhould apply themſelves to the Conformiſts, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs them with the Factiouſneſs, Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and Diſorders of the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, that ſo they might be provoked to ſpend their fury on each other to their mutual ruin.</p>
               <p>We anſwer; We hope that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and her right conformable Clergy, have bin ſo ſetled by the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of our Church, as not to have had their Principles corrupted by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Influence:</p>
               <p>As appears, 1. from the conſtant and ſtout oppoſition which Popery hath had from the Fathers and Sons of our Church.</p>
               <p>And, 2. in that the many ſurmiſes of the contrary, have proved, upon the teſt, very notoriouſly fooliſh and falſe. Let any of them prove our Principles and Practices ſuch, as we are able to do theirs, to ſerve the real Intereſt of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Let them know, that thoſe who
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:96474:281"/>
have bin moſt violently ſlandred as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of Popery, are known to have done more real and faithful ſervice to the Proteſtant Cauſe, than all thoſe that have entertained and promoted that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, have bin able to do. I will at preſent only mention Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> (whoſe Labours againſt Popery, and the other Separation were equally vigilant).</p>
               <p>Of whom the Letter of Diſcovery (of the Treaſon againſt the King and Kingdom, and the Proteſtant Religion, <hi>Octob.</hi> 1640.) thus ſpeaks; <hi>Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there remained on the King's part a knot hard to be untied; for the Lord Arch-Biſhop by his conſtancy, interpoſed himſelf as a hard Rock.</hi> And yet it was a lamentable hard caſe, that at the very ſame time the Reproaches and Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the People were inflamed againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> I. of bleſſed memory, and Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> under ſuſpicions of their favouring Popery; at the very ſame time the Jeſuits were conſpiring the killing of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. and alſo Arch-Biſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and the Convulſion of the Kingdom, and the Ruin of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and introducing of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, (as appears by the Diſcovery to Sir <hi>William Boſwell</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> 1640,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:96474:281"/>
and ſent over by him to the King and the Arch-Biſhop).</p>
               <p>Even thus hath bin the practice of the Romaniſts, to ſlander Princes alſo <hi>for being Papiſts, and then to aſſaſſinate them for being too zealous Proteſtants</hi>

               <p n="4">4. Whereas our Enthuſiaſtical Friends are ready to object unto us, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is either Popiſh, or in ſome degree prepared to be ſo, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe ſhe hath Biſhops, a Liturgy, and Ceremonies.</p>

               <p>For, 1. <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> aſſerted in our Church, is the greateſt oppoſition to Popery that is; for the very formality of Popery, is the Pope's Juriſdiction over all other Biſhops and Churches; which Authority of the Pope is no where ſo much contradicted, as by our Epiſcopacy.

               <p>2. A Reformed Liturgy as ours is, (ſeparated from all Popiſh Soyl and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption) muſt needs be it ſelf the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſecurity from Popery; ſince the want of it tends to bring in the worſt part of Popery, which is Enthuſiaſm, and Phanatical pretences to Revelation, and an Infallible Spirit, (as hath bin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly experienced).</p>
               <p>3. Our Ceremonies reformed from all Popiſh Reaſons and Ends of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, are uſeful to defend Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from Superſtition; uſing People to apprehend, that Chriſtian Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, neither in their neceſſary uſe, nor in their being neceſſarily refuſed; either of which is an equal infringing of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty.</p>
               <p>Much more might be added in defence of what is appointed in our Church, as the Marks and Bounds of a moderate Reformation; and do afford a better Apology and Defence againſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts, in the Judgment of the General Church, than they can have who fix upon falſe Principles, and therefore may the more eaſily be turned unto the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite extreme: Whereas the true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our Church gives her eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment

againſt each oppoſite Errors. Yea, it is manifeſt that our Church of <hi>England</hi> thus reteining Epiſcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and a well-reformed Liturgy, and while it obſerves Chriſtian Feſtivals, and a moderate outward decency in the Church of God, (as did the Churches of Chriſt in the Primitive Times) hath a fairer Plea and foundation of Argument, to invite and perſwade any from Romiſh Corruption, than a Diſſenter who will tell ſuch a one, That all that is Popery: which account of things may preſently beat him back, and make him conclude, that Proteſtants call that Popery, which in the pureſt and moſt Primitive Times, was practiſed in all Chriſtian Churches in the World. Whereas how eaſy a thing is it for a Popiſh Prieſt to turn himſelf into a Gifted Brother: And what Opinion is there of the Romaniſts, which may not come forth as a New Light? So that it was no ill Character of a Schiſmatic, <hi>He is a Papiſt turned wrong ſide outward.</hi>

               <p>But they all have given ſuch proof of their Rigour already, that all other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will think themſelves equally grieved then; and the cry for Toleration will continue to be as loud: and they can never expect from any Conſtitution, more Moderation than what our preſent Eſtabliſhment affords.</p>

               </p>
               <p>§. 1. AS from the very being of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Equity, we are certain that the nature of abſolute Good and Evil, Juſt and Unjuſt, doth not depend upon the Arbitrary Power of any, but is founded in the nature of Things and Circumſtances, (or elſe the Aſſertion of Equity would be very ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous); ſo we are ſure, from what hath bin largely declared, (eſpecially by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring other Extremes) That our Church of <hi>England</hi> is far from deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to uſe or encourage any arbitrary or rigorous way of Adminiſtration, which is contrary to the meaſures of natural Juſtice or Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>2. As from the nature of Moderation it hath appeared, that Benevolence is the true Fountain of Equity, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the moſt general Law of Nature, giving the beſt end and meaſure to all Actions, (eſpecially which have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the Public); which cauſeth Laws themſelves to bend, by all gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and benignity, to the general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:96474:285"/>
of all public and private Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which ought to be the Glory of God, and peace and good-will to Men: So we hope from the fore-going Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it appears alſo, that a benevolous inclination is implanted into the very frame and temper of our Church's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: and that from ſuch a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple it perſues the excellent ends menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; not only according to the Rules of Natural Juſtice, but the moſt fair and equal Meaſures of Gentleneſs alſo and Benignity. Wherefore it concerns us all, who live where the Laws of the Kingdom and the Church are framed and interpreted according to this equity, to acknowledg ſo great a Bleſſing. The ſame Conſideration aggravates the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of thoſe who perſue their own Prejudices, contrary to what is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed even ſo equitably and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately. And it is heartily to be wiſhed, that the Oppoſers of our Church could give any ſuch teſtimonies of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration as our Church hath done. <hi>Let any if they can,</hi> Romaniſt or Separatiſt, (of any particular denomination what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, as they are generally known among us) ſhew as much proof and
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:96474:286"/>
inſtance of their Moderation, as I have done of our Church.</p>
               <p>§. 2. But as in our firſt Chapter we laid down ſome general Rules, which are agreeable to natural Juſtice and Goodneſs, and alſo unto Chriſtianity, by which we are directed to judg the more truly of the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Nihil eſt tam praecla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum aut tam magnificum quod non Moderatione temperari deſideret.

<pb n="525" facs="tcp:96474:293"/>
I ſhould think it the moſt <hi>proper means</hi> by ſome ſuch degrees as follow to bring them, if it be poſſible, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the good Conſtitution of things among us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By letting ſuch, by clear Inſtances, ſee how unmoveably we hold <hi>the Faith and Doctrine of Chriſt delivered in Holy Scripture;</hi> which together with the whole Church of God, the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth keep inviolably, witneſs unto them faithfully, and ſo conſtantly appeal to, as the only perfect Rule of Faith and Manners. <hi>(V. Ch.</hi> 4.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. Since the beſt and moſt uſeful ſort of Moderation, is that which governs us as we ought, in the real Practice of Vertue and Goodneſs, whereunto tend all the Moderation of the Laws, and the Doctrine and Diſcipline of God's Church; yet (which is a lamentable thing to conſider) this is moſt ſilently paſt over, and ſcarce known by the Name at that ſame time, that a huge clamour is rais'd among us for Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Religion: in which, all that are concerned may know and underſtand, that the great Deſign and Deſire of our Church is to promote <hi>holineſs of Life.</hi> Among us, all may not only be as holy
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:96474:294"/>
as they will, but that they may be ſo, they are aſſiſted and encouraged moſt earneſtly, by the Laws, and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Offices, and Councils of our Church, (which if they were rightly underſtood, would be known uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to tend to no leſs).</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such may conſider that all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>means of Grace and Salvation,</hi> are by our Church publicly and amply taken care of, as duly and effectually as may be.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In a Church where ſubſtantial Piety is ſo truly procured throughout the whole Conſtitution; it might at leaſt mitigate the great offence taken to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider (what is more largely ſhewed <hi>Ch.</hi> 8.) That our Church never did own her very few Ceremonies, any other than accidental and mutable Circumſtances, for Order and Comelineſs-ſake; but never aſſerted them any eſſential or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary part of God's Worſhip. Such may alſo conſider the Rules of reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble behaviour and ſubmiſſion to the Church; as are moderately laid down <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. §. 10.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe our Diſſenters, by their dividing from us, ſeem to endanger ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much the Intereſt of the Reformed
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:96474:294"/>
Religion, which they appear ſo zealous to uphold; Let them be pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the real danger of their being acted by Romiſh Agents and Incendiaries, while they take the ſecond direct courſe to deſtroy this reformed Eſtabliſhment among us; as is more particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Such may do well to conſider tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thoſe eaſy and proper Conſequences which follow the Conſideration of the Church being a <hi>Society,</hi> with relation to a Chriſtian Kingdom as ours is; from whence ſundry ſpecial Obligations may be inferred, to bind every one who calls himſelf Chriſtian, to maintain the Peace and union of ſuch a Society; eſpecially if we look on the Church as a Society, formed by God himſelf; and therefore common Chriſtians are not to look upon themſelves as Spiritual Governors; as if they had any power in themſelves to conſtitute new Bounds, or new Extents, to its Being or Authority; but are to think they have an eaſier and ſafer task, quietly to accept and obey that which is conſtituted by lawful Authority, in all things not repugnant to the revealed Will of God.</p>
               <p>And ſince every one's being of the
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:96474:295"/>
Church doth ſuppoſe their duty to communicate in thoſe Sacraments and Holy Offices, which are appointed as a public Sign before God and Man, that we do confeſs <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our holding communion with God's Church, and that we are obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Laws of this Society, and the Government thereof, in that fixed part of the Church we live in; it follows that we are obliged unto the Peace of this Church by the intent of our Baptiſmal Vow, when we were incorporated as Members of Chriſt's Body, the Church: And we are bound to maintain the ſame Peace of this Society of the Church, as we live in a Chriſtian Kingdom, where the Religion of the Kingdom is ſo great a part of its Laws. Upon which account Schiſm renders the ſafety of Kingdoms very hazardous: beſide that it looſeth the Bands of all Friendſhip, Sacred and Civil, and breeds enmity among neareſt Relations and Neighbours: It tends ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to the diſhonour of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Laws, and opens a gap to the moſt diſſolute, making void the exerciſe and effect of the Diſcipline of the Church upon the ſcandalous; which otherwiſe to the prophane World would prove
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:96474:295"/>
terrible, as an Army with Banners: It is the only way any can take, to deſtroy all being of a Viſible Church; to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt her Doctrine, and deſtroy her Power, and is ſo great a ſin as Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it ſelf cannot expiate it: Such do as much as they can, make void the Deſign of our Bleſſed Saviour; <hi>Who died, that be might gather into one the Children of God that are ſcattered abroad,</hi> 11 S. <hi>John</hi> 52. the night before our Lord was betrayed, when he inſtituted the Sacrament of Unity; How fervently did he pray for the Peace of the Church! 17 S. <hi>John</hi> 11. <hi>Holy Father, keep through thy own Name, thoſe whom thou haſt given me, that they may be one, as I am one.</hi> (V. 21.) <hi>That they alſo may be one in us, that the World may believe that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> Whereas theſe Schiſms which we have, tend to weaken or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the greateſt outward Witneſs we have of the truth of Holy Scriptures, and of our very Chriſtianity; namely, the Teſtimony of God's Church from the beginning; and do expoſe our moſt excellent Religion, to the contempt and entertainment of Atheiſts. The ſad account for which let them beware of, who make it their idle buſineſs, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame

the Church in her Holy Offices, and alienate all whom they can from her Communion.</p>
               <p>Let them pretend what they will in the mean time to intimate Communion with God, they indeed take away the Unity of the Church as much as in them lies, but in effect they take it away from themſelves; and they cut themſelves off from Communion with the reſt of the Body; and by being diſſevered from the Body, how it is poſſible they ſhould retain Communion with the Head of that Body, God only knows, to whoſe infinite Mercy we leave them.</p>
               <p>It is ſeriouſly and heartily to be wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Duty and Benefits of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church, were duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by all: and the many more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Miſchiefs of Schiſm than have bin here mentioned: and in reference to our <hi>Church of England</hi> in particular, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly her Moderation is a great aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Schiſms which are; ſo I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it a moſt true obſervation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the common conſent of all, <hi>That the only Reaſon why our Church is not more generally embraced and admired, is, becauſe the Purity of its Doctrine, the Sobriety of its Devotion, the Moderation of its Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,</hi>
                  <pb n="531" facs="tcp:96474:296"/>

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore we wiſh that by God's Grace working love in all the hearts of thoſe who do not underſtand &amp; conſider ſo much: they would yet conſent to what the Peaceful and Holy <hi>Nazianzen</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares in one of his Orations of Peace; <hi>Thus</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I reſolve, it is not good to be more indifferent than is meet, nor too hot; either through levity to be carried about with every one, nor by diſorder to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from all: when the manifeſt things of wickedneſs require our compliance, then we are to conteſt with Fire and Sword, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than partake of their Leven: But when only a ſuſpicion of evil ſeizeth on our minds, then Moderation and Condeſcention are more adviſable, rather than make a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from others we relate unto as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Wherefore let us embrace each other, and be ſincerely one, and imitate our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Mediatour, who by his Blood hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled all things, and made peace: Let us ſay to our Common Father, Behold thy Sons gathered into One.</hi> Unto which I muſt add what the ſame Father from thoſe Diſſentions which were in the Church did conceive, namely, a great

               <p>Neither I conceive is it enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their Schiſm, nor to render our Church ſo immoderate, as not to be communicated with, for any to give ſome Inſtances, which according to ſome Judgments they would have otherwiſe; ſince it is moſt impoſſible to have any conſtitution of things free from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of exception; and alſo againſt the moſt perfect things, great enmities may be raiſed, for want of equally conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Principles, Rules, and Ends for which thoſe things were eſtabliſhed. Neither is it enough to except againſt what is faulty in particular Perſons, when the ſame is no vice of the public Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.

Sure then it may be judged a very unreaſonable manner of ſundry ſorts of Men anſwering ſuch Diſcourſes as pinch them, namely by catching at ſome little ſcattered parts, of the Skirts and Margent of the Cauſe: Or when they cannot by unbiaſſed Reaſons have victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their Conteſt, then they readily fall off to Perſonal Matters, which in no ſort tend to the Merits of any Cauſe: and by theſe methods they hope to buoy up the Party, which is the main thing they generally aim at.</p>
